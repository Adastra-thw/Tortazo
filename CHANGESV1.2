CHANGES IN TORTAZO V1.2
- Well, firstly, I've developed an "community" version of Tortazo available freely and another "pro" version which requires subscription with more advanced features.
- DJango REST Framework integration to expose the main features of Tortazo to any developer/tool. 
- Web interface using AngularJS to  execute Tortazo from a web browser. This web application consumes the Tortazo REST API.
- Refactorization of the main script "Tortazo.py" using the pattern "facade" to abstract the main functions of Tortazo and expose his features via a simple API. This is very useful, specially for the DJango interface and the REST Services which runs Tortazo from the web interface.
- Custom database configuration for SQLite and PostgreSQL.
