                Google+ is a place to discuss many topics, but not every topic is appropriate for
                all ages or in all countries. Because the promotion of certain products and
                services is heavily regulated, we have created tools to help you target your
                content to users of the appropriate ages in the right markets.
              </p>
              <p>
                If your content promotes regulated goods and services, including alcohol, gambling,
                pharmaceuticals, tobacco, fireworks, weapons, or health/medical devices, you are
                responsible for applying the appropriate age and geographical restrictions for that
                content. If we receive a complaint that such content is targeting audiences in
                violation of applicable laws and regulations, we may remove or restrict the
                offending content or account.
              </p>
              <p>
                With the appropriate age and geographical restrictions in place, we allow
                discussion and promotion of these goods, but we do not allow the facilitation of
                the sale of the products listed above.
