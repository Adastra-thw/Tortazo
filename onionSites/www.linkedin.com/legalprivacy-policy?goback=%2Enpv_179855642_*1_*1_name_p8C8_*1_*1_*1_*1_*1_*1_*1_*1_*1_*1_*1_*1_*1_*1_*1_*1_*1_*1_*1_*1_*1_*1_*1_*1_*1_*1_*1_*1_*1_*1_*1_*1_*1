Our Privacy Policy has been updated primarily to also cover, as part of LinkedIn, the SlideShare and Pulse services, reflecting LinkedIn&rsquo;s acquisition of the two companies in 2012 and 2013, respectively, and our subsequent integration efforts. <a onclick="LI.popup(this.href); return false;" href="/legal/pop/pop-privacy-policy-summary?goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">Please click here to read our summary of the changes</a>.

<p>LinkedIn&rsquo;s mission is to connect the world&rsquo;s professionals to enable them to be more productive and successful. Our registered users (&ldquo;Members&rdquo;) share their professional identities, engage with their network, exchange knowledge and professional insights, post and view relevant content, and find business opportunities. Content on some of our services is also visible to unregistered viewers (&ldquo;Visitors&rdquo;). We believe that our services allow our Members to effectively compete and achieve their full career potential. The cornerstone of our business is to focus on our Members first.</p>

<div class="row first">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.1. Data Controllers</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>Our Privacy Policy applies to any Member or Visitor. If you live in the U.S., LinkedIn Corporation controls your information. If you live outside the U.S., LinkedIn Ireland controls your information.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>If you reside in the United States, then the personal information provided to or gathered by LinkedIn is controlled by LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043. If you reside outside the United States, then the personal information provided to or gathered by LinkedIn is controlled by LinkedIn Ireland, Gardner House, Wilton Place, Wilton Plaza, Dublin 2, Ireland. If you have any concern about providing information to us or having such information displayed on the LinkedIn services or otherwise used in any manner permitted in this Privacy Policy and the User Agreement (together also referred to as LinkedIn&rsquo;s Terms of Service), you should not become a Member of LinkedIn, visit our websites, apps or otherwise use our Services.

We collect your personal information in the following ways:</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.2. Registration</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>When you create an account with us, you provide us with information (including your name, email address, and password) that we use to offer you a personalized, relevant experience on LinkedIn.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>
To create an account on LinkedIn, you must provide us with at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. You can choose to provide further information about yourself during the registration process (for example, your gender and location). We use this information to provide you with more customized services like language-specific profile pages, updates, and content, more relevant ads, and more valuable career opportunities, and it may appear on your LinkedIn profile that is viewable by others. You understand that, by creating an account, LinkedIn and others will be able to identify you by your LinkedIn profile, and you allow LinkedIn to use this information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our <a href="/legal/user-agreement">User Agreement</a>. We may also ask for your credit card details if you purchase certain LinkedIn services.
</p>
<p>We also provide the option to register for a SlideShare account, for which you must provide at least your name, email address and/or mobile number, and a password. We no longer provide the option to register for a separate Pulse account, but you may continue to use your existing Pulse account if you already have one, as described <a href="http://help.linkedin.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/44735/loc/na/trk/NoPageKey/?goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">here</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.3. Profile Information</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>You can add professional details &ndash; like your job title, education, and skills &ndash; to your profile. A complete profile helps you be found by other people for opportunities. It also means we can show you relevant ads and content.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>After you create an account (other than the distinct SlideShare and Pulse accounts), you may choose to provide additional information on your LinkedIn <a href="/profile/edit">profile</a>, such as descriptions of your skills, professional experience, and educational background. You can list honors, awards, professional affiliations, LinkedIn Group memberships, networking objectives, companies or individuals that you follow, and other information including content. With your approval, your connections may provide recommendations and endorsements of you. Providing additional information enables you to derive more benefit from LinkedIn by helping you express your professional identity; find other professionals, opportunities, and information; and help recruiters and business opportunities find you. It also enables us to serve you ads and other relevant content on and off LinkedIn.</p>
<p>If you have or create an account on SlideShare, you can choose what additional personal information you provide there besides the required information (name, email address and password). Most of your SlideShare profile, as well as all content that you post on SlideShare, is publicly displayed (with the exceptions provided in the SlideShare account settings), so please do not provide personal information you would not want to be public. We may use and share information you provide in a SlideShare profile and/or Pulse account in the same manner as the information provided in a LinkedIn.com profile, in accordance with this Privacy Policy and our User Agreement.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="row">
<h3 class="copy-header">1.4. Address Book and Other Services That Sync with LinkedIn</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We collect information when you sync non-LinkedIn content &ndash; like your email address book, mobile device contacts, or calendar &ndash; with your account. We use this information to improve your experience and allow you and your network to be better connected. You can remove your address book and any other synced information whenever you&#x27;d like.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>You may use the LinkedIn contacts importer (or other similar mechanisms provided by LinkedIn) to upload individual contacts or your entire address book into LinkedIn. LinkedIn stores this information and uses it to help you manage and leverage your contacts. We also use this information to enhance your LinkedIn experience by helping you to grow your network by: identifying your contacts already on LinkedIn; providing a template to send invitations to your contacts that have not registered with LinkedIn; and suggesting people you may know but who may not be in your LinkedIn contacts. LinkedIn may also use this information to show you and other Members that you share the same uploaded contacts who may or may not be Members. Please note that when you send an invitation to connect to another individual (a &ldquo;connection&rdquo;), that person may have access to your email address or, for SMS invitations, mobile number because it is displayed in the invitation. LinkedIn will also remind you of pending invitations. Your LinkedIn connections will also have access to your email address.</p>
<p>LinkedIn makes other tools available to sync information with LinkedIn, and may also develop additional features that allow Members to use their LinkedIn account in conjunction with other third-party services. For example, LinkedIn&rsquo;s mobile applications may allow you to sync your device&rsquo;s calendar, email and/or contacts apps with LinkedIn to show you the LinkedIn profiles of meeting attendees, email correspondents and/or your contacts.</p>
<p>Another example are software tools that allow you to see LinkedIn and other public social media information about the people you email or meet with and leverage LinkedIn to help you gain insights from and grow your network. If you grant these products (mobile applications or other LinkedIn services that sync external email and calendar services, such as LinkedIn Connected) permission to access your email and calendar accounts, they will access and may store some of your email header and calendar history information in order to match it to LinkedIn and other public social media profiles. LinkedIn&rsquo;s products that sync with external email services may also temporarily cache message content for performance reasons, in a way that is unreadable by LinkedIn and its service providers.</p>
<p>Any information that you upload or sync with LinkedIn is covered by the User Agreement and this Privacy Policy. You can remove your information at your convenience using the features LinkedIn makes available or in accordance with Section 3. You can remove your address book and any other synced information at any time.</p>

<h3 class="copy-header">1.6. Using the LinkedIn Sites and Applications</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We collect information when you visit LinkedIn (including SlideShare and Pulse), use our mobile applications, and interact with advertising on LinkedIn.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We collect information when you use (whether as a Member or a Visitor) the LinkedIn websites (including SlideShare.net and Pulse.me), applications (for example, LinkedIn or Pulse for iPhone or Android), LinkedIn platform technology (such as &ldquo;Share on LinkedIn&rdquo; plugins for publishers) or other Services. For example, we collect information when you view or click on ads, import your address book, join and participate in groups, participate in polls, install a LinkedIn mobile application, view content on Pulse or SlideShare, and share articles on LinkedIn. If you are logged in on LinkedIn.com, SlideShare.net, the Pulse app or another Service or a LinkedIn cookie on your device identifies you, your usage information and the log data described in Section 1.10 of this policy, such as your IP address, will be associated with your account.

</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We receive information when you use your LinkedIn account to log in to a third-party website or application. Also, when you visit a third-party site that embeds LinkedIn professional plugins (such as &ldquo;Share on LinkedIn&rdquo; for publishers) we receive information that those pages have loaded in your web browser. If you are logged in as a Member when you visit sites with LinkedIn plugins, we use this information to recommend tailored content to you. LinkedIn will use this information to personalize the LinkedIn-provided functionality on third-party sites, including providing you insights from your LinkedIn network and allowing you to share information with your network (1st and 2nd degree connection on LinkedIn). Users wishing to disable this personalization may <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups&modal=nsettings-data-sharing&goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">opt out</a> here. LinkedIn&rsquo;s retention of this data is addressed in Section 3.2. We do not use this information for advertising. LinkedIn may provide reports containing aggregated impression information to companies hosting LinkedIn plugins and similar technologies to help them measure LinkedIn-generated traffic to their websites. You can opt out of LinkedIn using your impression data by clicking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=groups&modal=nsettings-offsite-privacy-management&goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">here</a>.

<p>We target ads to Members and Visitors both on and off LinkedIn through a variety of ad networks and ad exchanges, using:</p>
<ul>
<li>Advertising technologies like web beacons, pixels, ad tags, cookies, and mobile identifiers as permitted by mobile platforms both on and off LinkedIn;</li>
<li>Member-provided profile information and categories (for example, &ldquo;product managers in Texas&rdquo;);</li>
<li>Information inferred from a Member&rsquo;s profile (for example, using job titles to infer age, industry, seniority, and compensation bracket; or names to infer gender);</li>
<li>Your use of LinkedIn (for example, your LinkedIn search history, the content you read on SlideShare or Pulse, who you follow or is following you on SlideShare, etc.) or clicking on a LinkedIn ad;</li>
<li>Information from advertising partners which we use to help deliver ads more relevant to you.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not share personally identifiable information with any third-party advertiser or ad network, although your profile is visible to other Members and through public search depending on your settings.</p>
<p>LinkedIn may show you sponsored content in your Network Update Stream (NUS), which will be designated as sponsored content and will behave like other NUS updates. If you take social action (for example, if you &ldquo;like or &ldquo;comment&rdquo; on the sponsored content), your action will be seen by your network and other Members who are shown the sponsored content after you have acted on it. Please note that all social actions on SlideShare (e.g. liking certain content, following or being followed by others) are public, unless expressly specified otherwise with respect to premium accounts.</p>
<p>LinkedIn ads that are delivered on third-party sites contain the label &ldquo;Ads by LinkedIn.&rdquo; You may opt out of (i) these ads served to you on third-party sites and/or (ii) us using information from advertising partners to target ads by going <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=account&modal=nsettings-enhanced-advertising&goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">here</a>.

<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We collect information from the devices and networks that you use to access LinkedIn. This information helps us improve and secure our Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>When you visit or leave LinkedIn sites or apps (whether as a Member or Visitor) by clicking a hyperlink or when you view a plugin on a third-party site, we automatically receive the URL of the site from which you came or the one to which you are directed. Also, advertisers receive the URL of the page that you are on when you click an ad on LinkedIn. We also receive the internet protocol (&ldquo;IP&rdquo;) address of your computer or the proxy server that you use to access the web, your computer operating system details, your type of web browser, your mobile device (including your mobile device identifier provided by your mobile device operating system), your mobile operating system (if you are accessing LinkedIn using a mobile device), and the name of your ISP or your mobile carrier. We may also receive location data passed to us from third-party services or GPS-enabled devices that you have set up, which we use to show you local information (for example, Pulse articles about your area) on our mobile applications. Most mobile devices allow you to prevent real time location data being sent to LinkedIn, and of course LinkedIn will honor your settings.</p>
<p>In the case of our Android apps, you will be provided notice of the types of data (e.g. location) that will be sent to us. If you choose to use our app after this notice, we process this data to enable registration or preview product features for you (e.g. jobs near you). If you choose not to become a Member, we will delete this information.</p>

</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>LinkedIn is a dynamic, innovative environment, which means we are always seeking to improve the services we offer you. We often introduce new features, some of which may result in the collection of new information (for example, when the Endorsements feature launched, we began collecting information about skills for which Members were endorsed and the individuals who endorsed them). Furthermore, new partnerships or corporate acquisitions may result in new features, and we may potentially collect new types of information.</p>

<p>With certain communications you send on LinkedIn, the recipient can see your name, email address, and some network information.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>Many communications that you initiate through LinkedIn (for example, an invitation sent to a non-Member) will list your name and primary email address in the header of the message. Messages you initiate may also provide the recipient with aggregate information about your network (for example, how many people are in your network). Other communications that you initiate through the Services, like a request for an introduction, will list your name as the initiator but will not include your personal email address contact information.

<p>We use information that you provide to us to customize your experience and the experiences of others on LinkedIn. For example, when you sign in to your account, we may display the names of new Members who have recently joined your network or recent updates from your connections and companies you follow.

<p>We may share your personal information with our LinkedIn affiliates (meaning entities controlled by, controlling or under common control with LinkedIn) outside of the LinkedIn entity that is your data controller (for example, LinkedIn Corporation may share your information with LinkedIn Ireland, or other LinkedIn operating entities) as necessary to provide the Services. By agreeing to this Privacy Policy, you are consenting to this sharing.</p>
<p>For clarity, LinkedIn and its affiliates combine information internally across different Services. For example, SlideShare may recommend better content to you based on your LinkedIn content preferences and the articles you read on Pulse, and LinkedIn could present you a better tailored network update stream based on your SlideShare activity, whether or not you tied your SlideShare, Pulse and/or LinkedIn accounts (e.g. by signing in SlideShare or Pulse with your LinkedIn account), as we may be able to identify you across different Services using cookies or similar technologies.</p>

This public profile will be indexed and displayed through public search engines when someone searches for your name. You may choose the parts of your profile that search engines index or completely opt out of this feature in your LinkedIn account <a href="/profile/public-profile-settings">settings</a>, or limit the publicly visible information in your SlideShare profile. However, third-party search engines may not automatically update their caches, which may contain old public profile information. Unless you delete them, your profiles on LinkedIn.com and our corresponding app or on SlideShare.net are always viewable on the respective Services.</p>
<p>We do not rent or sell personal information that you have not posted on LinkedIn, except as described in this Privacy Policy. We will not disclose personal information that is not published to your profile or generated through engagement with other LinkedIn services, such as Groups and Company Pages, without your consent or to carry out your instructions (for example, to process payment information) unless LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is permitted by law or is reasonably necessary to: (1) comply with a legal requirement or process, including, but not limited to, civil and criminal subpoenas, court orders or other compulsory disclosures; (2) enforce this Privacy Policy or our User Agreement; (3) respond to claims of a violation of the rights of third parties; (4) respond to Member service inquiries; or (5) protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, Visitors, or the public. See Section 2.14 for additional details about LinkedIn&rsquo;s compliance with legal requests for information.</p>
<p>
LinkedIn supports middleware providers that offer archiving solutions to firms subject to financial services regulation, which, with your permission, facilitate the archiving of your communications and other LinkedIn activity by a third party for compliance purposes.
Content distributed through LinkedIn&rsquo;s sharing features and third-party integrations may result in displaying some of your personal information outside of LinkedIn. For example, when you post content to a LinkedIn Group that is open for public discussion, your content, including your name as the contributor, may be displayed in search engine results. Also, if you have bound your LinkedIn account to your Twitter account or your SlideShare or Pulse account to your Facebook account, you can easily share content from LinkedIn to Twitter or from SlideShare or Pulse to Facebook, in accordance with your applicable account settings (which you may change at any time) and respective Twitter or Facebook policies.
Further, LinkedIn allows third parties to look-up profile information (subject to your privacy settings) using your email address or first and last name information through its profile API (see Section 2.7. below).
</p>
<p>Third parties (for example, your email provider) may give you the option to upload certain information in your LinkedIn contacts onto their own service. If you choose to share your LinkedIn contacts, you will be granting your third party provider the right to store, access, disclose and use your LinkedIn contacts in the ways described in such third party's terms and privacy policy.</p>

<h3 class="copy-header">2.7. Third Parties Using LinkedIn Platform Services</h3>
<div class="brief-copy">
<p>We work with developers to build Platform Applications using LinkedIn&rsquo;s developer tools. Whether you use Platform Applications is up to you. If you have given a Platform Application access to your LinkedIn account, you can revoke that permission anytime. Also, you can opt out of providing information to developers through your connections.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>We collaborate with and allow third parties to use LinkedIn&rsquo;s developer platform to offer services and functionality in conjunction with LinkedIn. These third-party developers have either negotiated an agreement to use LinkedIn platform technology or have agreed to our self-service API and Plugin terms in order to build applications (&ldquo;Platform Applications&rdquo;). Both the negotiated agreements and our API and Plugin terms contain restrictions on how third parties may access, store, and use the personal information you provide to LinkedIn. If you choose to use a Platform Application, you will be asked to confirm acceptance of the privacy policy and user agreement of the third-party developer. To revoke permission granted to a Platform Application, please visit your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">settings</a>. Note, however, that even if you revoke the permission granted to a Platform Application, your connections may still be using the Platform Application, so the Platform Application may still have access to certain information about you, just as your connections do.

</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>Polls and Surveys may be conducted by LinkedIn, Members, or third parties. Some third parties may target advertisements to you on the results page based on your answers in the poll. LinkedIn or third parties may follow up with you via InMail regarding your participation unless you have opted out of receiving InMail messages. We may use third parties to deliver incentives to you to participate in surveys or polls. If the delivery of incentives requires your contact information, you may be asked to provide personal information to the third party fulfilling the incentive offer, which will be used only for the purpose of delivering incentives and verifying your contact information. It is up to you whether you provide this information, or whether you desire to take advantage of an incentive. Your consent to use any personally identifiable information for the purposes set forth in the poll or survey will be explicitly requested by the party conducting it. LinkedIn is a member of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations (&ldquo;CASRO&rdquo;) and abides by CASRO guidelines for market research. You may opt out of participating in surveys by changing your <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/settings/?tab=email&modal=nsettings-research-invitations&goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">settings</a> to stop receiving these inquiries and requests.</p>

You may limit or prevent such subscribers from exporting your profile information by configuring your <a href="/profile/public-profile-settings?goback=%2Enpv_179855642_*1_*1_name_p8C8_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1_*1">public profile visibility settings</a> to restrict access to these fields. We do not provide email or other contact information to these subscribers. However, if you post that information as part of your profile it will be available to them and others. A recruiter or other such subscriber may also manage and store information it has independently obtained about you outside of our Services, such as a resume, in connection with LinkedIn&rsquo;s platform. Any personal information obtained independently of LinkedIn services will not be added by LinkedIn to your profile and is not under LinkedIn&rsquo;s control but is subject to the policies of the LinkedIn recruiting, marketing or sales solution subscriber.

It is possible that we may need to disclose personal information, profile information, or information about your activities as a Member or Visitor when required by law, subpoena, or other legal process, or if LinkedIn has a good faith belief that disclosure is reasonably necessary to (1) investigate, prevent, or take action regarding suspected or actual illegal activities or to assist government enforcement agencies; (2) enforce the User Agreement, investigate and defend ourselves against any third-party claims or allegations, or protect the security or integrity of our Service; or (3) exercise or protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, our Members, personnel, or others.
We attempt to notify Members about legal demands for their data when appropriate in our judgment, unless prohibited by law or court order or when the request is an emergency. In light of our principles, we may dispute such demands when we believe, in our discretion, that the requests are overbroad, vague or lack proper authority, but do not commit to challenge every demand.

<p>You can change your LinkedIn information at any time by editing your profile, deleting content that you have posted, or by closing your account. You can also ask us for additional information we may have about your account.</p>
</div>
<div class="full-copy">
<p>You have a right to (1) access, modify, correct, or delete your personal information controlled by LinkedIn regarding your profile, (2) change or remove your content, and (3) close your account. You can also contact us for any account information which is not on your profile or readily accessible to you. If you close your account(s), your information will generally be removed from the Service within 24 hours. We generally delete closed account information and will de-personalize any logs or other backup information within 30 days of account closure, except as noted below.</p>
<p>With respect to SlideShare accounts and activity, if you would like us to delete your record and/or remove a particular comment you have made on SlideShare.net, or to provide a copy of any personal data to which you may be entitled, please contact us at privacy@slideshare.com.

<p><strong>Please note:</strong> Information you have shared with others (for example, through InMail, network updates, content sharing, or LinkedIn Groups) or that others have copied may also remain visible after you have closed your account or deleted the information from your own profile. LinkedIn Groups content associated with closed accounts will show an unknown user as the source. In addition, you may not be able to access, correct, or eliminate any information about you that other Members copied or exported out of LinkedIn, because this information may not be in our control.
