<p>LinkedIn may offer the Services through applications built using LinkedIn&rsquo;s platform (&ldquo;LinkedIn Applications&rdquo;). Examples of LinkedIn Applications include its smart phone applications (e.g. LinkedIn and Pulse for Android and iOS), and LinkedIn&rsquo;s &ldquo;Share&rdquo; buttons and other interactive plugins distributed on websites across the web.

Further, by importing any of your LinkedIn data through the LinkedIn Application, you represent that you have authority to share the transferred data with your mobile carrier or other access provider. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile account, you must promptly update your LinkedIn account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number and failure to do so is your responsibility. You acknowledge you are responsible for all charges and necessary permissions related to accessing LinkedIn through your mobile access provider. Therefore, you should check with your provider to find out if the Services are available and the terms for these services for your specific mobile devices.

<p>LinkedIn offers various forums such as LinkedIn Groups and Network Updates, where you can post your observations and comments on designated topics. LinkedIn also enables sharing of information by allowing users to post updates, including links to news articles and other information such as job opportunities, product recommendations, and other content to their profile and other Services, such as SlideShare, LinkedIn Groups and LinkedIn Company Pages. LinkedIn members can create LinkedIn Groups and Company Pages for free, however, LinkedIn, in its sole discretion, may close or transfer LinkedIn Groups or Company Pages, or remove content from them or from anywhere on the Services if the content violates this Agreement or others&rsquo; intellectual property rights. Please note that ideas you post and information you share may be seen and used by other Members or, if public, by Visitors (note also that all content you post on SlideShare is publicly visible unless you restrict it to a private audience as a premium subscriber), and LinkedIn cannot guarantee that other Members will or will not use the ideas and information that you share on LinkedIn, nor the manner of use. Therefore, if you have an idea or information that you would like to keep confidential or don&rsquo;t want others to use, or that is subject to third party rights that may be infringed by your sharing it, do not post it to any LinkedIn Group, into your Network Updates, or elsewhere on LinkedIn.
