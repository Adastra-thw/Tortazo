<h1>TERMS OF SERVICES AGREEMENT</h1>
<br />
<p>The following Terms of Service govern your use of the RankPay, LLC ("RankPay") Web Site located at rankpay.com, including any services and features available on or through the Web Site such as content writing services, seo services, hosting services, coding, script installations, and directory submissions. The Website is made available by RankPay. We may change the Terms of Service from time to time, at any time, by posting such changes on the Site. BY USING THE SITE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AS APPLIED TO YOUR USE OF THE SITE. If you do not agree to these Terms of Service, you may not access or otherwise use the Site.</p>

<h2>1.) Services Provided</h2>
<p>"RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program" begins upon the submission of desired keywords from a prospective Customer. Upon completion of RankPay's Keyword Submission Process the Customer will receive "RankPay's Introductory Welcome E-mail' that displays that a RankPay Account has been created, and provides the customer with next steps in the "Account Set-up and Implementation Process" including an On-Page Optimization overview, and provides the Customer with contact information for RankPay Support via Phone, E-mail and/or Online Chat. "RankPay's Introductory Welcome E-mail" also shares the destination pages for RankPay's Blog, FAQ section, and process for submitting a Support Ticket through the Customer Dashboard.</p>
<p>The "Keyword Activation" date represents the date which each keyword and the associated destination page on the customer's website has been approved by RankPay, and the Customer. Accordingly, "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program" will begin on the date of approval from both RankPay and the Customer. This "Keyword Activation" date marks the beginning of the program, and remains in effect for (6) months.</p>
<p>Ranking reports are updated a minimum of (4) times per month within the Customer Dashboard which all Active RankPay Customers have a login/password to their specific programs. As an Active RankPay Customer, the Customer Dashboard is available at any time. Within RankPay's Customer Dashboard, the Customer also has full access to their Account Information, All Active Keywords, All Pending Keywords, All Deactivated Keywords, a Keyword Watchlist to monitor non-active keywords, and a SEO Services Activity Description Report for their Active Keywords participating in "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program."</p>


<h2>2.) Pricing and Invoicing Terms</h2>
<p>
	Pricing for each keyword is determined at the time of "Keyword Approval", and pricing is therefore locked for the duration of "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program", and will not change at any time during the (6) month period. Customer invoicing is performed monthly by RankPay. The invoicing charges are based exclusively on ranking performance, and tied directly to the agreed-upon pricing during "Keyword Approval". Customer invoicing takes place on the 1st day of each new month, and the keyword rankings on Google + Bing/Yahoo! determine the customer monthly charges.
</p>

	<blockquote style='margin-bottom:20px;'>
		Example: Keyword 'x' has an agreed-upon price of $129 if the customer's listing reaches Ranking #1-3 on Google. Keyword 'x' also has an agreed-upon price of $63 if the customer's listing reaches Positions #7-10 on Bing/Yahoo!. If the customer's listing is ranked #1 on Google and ranked #8 on Yahoo/Bing on the 'Invoicing Day' when the Monthly Rankings are run and completed, then the customer would be charged a total of $192 on the Customers Monthly Invoice. This example includes $129 for the increased ranking on Google, and $63 for the increased ranking on Bing/Yahoo!.
	</blockquote>

<p>
	Customer invoicing is based solely on progress of a keyword ranking into the Top 30 non-paid rankings on Google + Bing/Yahoo! search results pages. Therefore, customers are never billed if their ranking has decreased from its original position at the time of "Keyword Activation", or if the listing has not improved within the Top 30 non-paid rankings on either Google and/or Bing/Yahoo!. Customer invoicing is completed via the Customer Credit Card on file for the account, which the Customer provides and the Customer and RankPay approve. Customer's credit card on file is automatically charged once per month based upon the rankings within the search engines on the 'Invoicing Day', which is the first day of each new month. No charges will be applied if the customer's keyword ranking does not improve from its original position, or improves without earning rankings in the Top 30 non-paid rankings on Google and/or Bing/Yahoo!. If a customer deactivates a keyword before completing the (6) months of "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program", the customer's credit card will be charged a "Deactivation Fee" of $200 for each "Active" Keyword that is transitioned to "De-active" status.
</p>

<p>When a keyword has completed the (6) months of "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program" - the keyword will automatically continue with the program. However, the customer has the ability to the following (3) program considerations at their sole discretion:</p>

<ol style='list-style-type:decimal;'>
	<li>Upon completion of (6) months with "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program", the customer can choose to deactivate any and/or all keywords at any time without any Deactivation Fee. If the customer chooses to deactivate keywords and cancel service, a pro-rated monthly service fee for that month will be charged based on the keyword ranking on the date of deactivation, and the Customer Account will be formally closed.</li>
	<li>Customer can choose to transition to "RankPay's SEO Services Maintenance Program" if the keyword ranking reaches the top 10 positions on Google. If the customer chooses to transition to "RankPay's SEO Services Maintenance Program" after the 6-Month Program is completed, the keyword pricing will then be reduced by 50% of the monthly program price, as long as the keyword remains in Active Status.</li>
	<li>Customer can elect to have their Account remain open, allowing "RankPay's Performance-Based SEO Services Program" to continue for any and/or all existing Active keywords, and cancel at any time. If customer cancels keyword after (6) month program, applicable monthly pro-rated charges will be applied based on the date of keyword deactivation, although there will not be any deactivation charges.  All keyword deactivation(s) and/or account closure must be formally documented and provided to RankPay in writing directly from the account owner that originated the account, and submitted directly through RankPay's Customer Dashboard Ticketing System.  <a href="https://www.rankpay.com/login">https://www.rankpay.com/login</a>.  RankPay will respond to the request and confirm in writing the keyword deactivation and/or the account closure</li>
</ol>
	

<!--<p>
	Please note: the only exception to "Services Provided" in Section 1, and "Pricing and Invoicing Terms" highlighted in Section 2 is for a Local Promotion which RankPay is running from September 1, 2012 through September 30, 2012.  During the Local Promotion, all Local Keywords that have been approved by RankPay, and Activated by the Customer are subject to cancellation at any point in time without the Standard "Deactivation Fee" of $200 per keyword.  As an example, a Local Keyword is defined as a keyword phrase which includes a city, state and/or county as part of the keyword phrase, example: "San Diego Real Estate".  Pro-rated monthly charges will still apply if indeed a Local Keyword is cancelled during the month, after obtaining an increased ranking between rankings 1-30.

<h2>19.) Applicable Laws and Dispute Resolution</h2>
<p>We control and operate the Site from our offices in the United States of America. We do not represent that materials on the Site are appropriate or available for use in other locations. Persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative, and are responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. This Terms of Services Agreement and the relationship between you and us shall be governed by the laws of the United States and the State of California, without regard to its conflict of law provisions. All parties agree that in the event of any dispute with respect to this Terms of Services Agreement or any respective obligations hereunder, such dispute shall be settled by arbitration in the County of San Diego, State of California, in accordance with the commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association. Any award rendered by the arbitrators shall be final and judgment may be entered upon it in any court of competent jurisdiction. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Terms of Services Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.

<h2>20.) Termination & Refunds</h2>
<p>RankPay may terminate, change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Site or the Site's services at any time. We may restrict, impose limits on, suspend or terminate your access to the Site and/or its services or features (e.g., our blog(s)) if we believe you have violated this Terms of Services Agreement or applicable law, or for any other reason without notice or liability. RankPay maintains a policy that provides for the termination in appropriate circumstances of the Web Site use privileges of users who are repeat infringers of intellectual property rights. "Insolvent" accounts are active accounts that have not paid their monthly invoice within (7) business days from the initial date of insolvency. These "Insolvent" accounts will remain active for (90) days in RankPay's program, and then they will be terminated.  During the (90-day period), RankPay will e-mail the "Insolvent" a minimum of (3) times displaying the outstanding balance based upon the invoices which have not been paid. If correspondence efforts have not been responded to by the "Insolvent" account after the (90-day) period, RankPay will then send the "Insolvent" account to an Independent 3rd Party Collections Agency inclusive of the outstanding balance owed.  If the account does not pay the outstanding balance, or comply with the Independent 3rd Party Collections Agency, and then subsequently re-creates a new account, RankPay is permitted to charge the credit card to bring the outstanding balance current, before proceeding with the new account activation.  RankPay will utilize it's proprietary Fraud Prevention System to help identify and detect "Insolvent", "Terminated" and/or "Fraudulent" accounts from "RankPay's Performance-based SEO Service Program". Cancellation of a RankPay account is permitted unless the account currently has one or more active keywords. Due to the nature of our performance-based services, our upfront pricing and the fact that customers are not charged unless they receive an enhanced search engine ranking, refunds cannot be provided. All keyword deactivation(s) and/or account closure must be formally documented and provided to RankPay in writing directly from the account owner that originated the account, and submitted directly through RankPay's Customer Dashboard Ticketing System at <a href="https://www.rankpay.com/login">https://www.rankpay.com/login</a>. RankPay will respond to the request and confirm in writing the keyword deactivation and/or the account closure.</p>

<h2>21.) Changes to Terms of Service</h2>
<p>RankPay reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove any portion of these Terms of Service, in whole or in part, at any time. Changes to the Terms of Service will be effective when posted.</p>
