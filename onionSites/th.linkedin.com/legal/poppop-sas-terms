<h1>LinkedIn Ads Agreement</h1>
<h3><strong>Important! Please read:</strong></h3>
<p>It is important that you read, understand, and agree to this entire document, as it creates a binding contract between you and LinkedIn (&quot;LinkedIn&quot; or &quot;us&quot; or &quot;we&quot;). These terms and conditions define and limit your rights and responsibilities in using LinkedIn Ads. We may revise these terms and conditions (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) at any time by posting them to the site. You will be bound by such revisions and should therefore visit this page from time to time to review the current terms and conditions.</p>
<h3>User Agreement:</h3>
<p>In addition this Agreement, the standard <a href="/legal/user-agreement">LinkedIn User Agreement</a>, and those documents which it references, including by not limited to the <a href="/legal/privacy-policy">LinkedIn Privacy Policy</a> and <a href="/legal/copyright-policy">Copyright Policy</a>, applies to your use of the LinkedIn Ads service. To the extent there is any conflict between this Agreement and any of the provisions in the standard LinkedIn User Agreement with respect to your use of the LinkedIn Ads service, this Agreement shall control but only to extent of such conflict.</p>
<h3>Advertising Entity:</h3>
<p>You may only advertise for yourself or your current employer or, if you are an advertising agency, for your client. You warrant and represent that you have the power and authority to enter into this Agreement and perform the obligations hereunder and that you are personally responsible for any charges incurred through your account. Use of any automated agents (&quot;bots&quot;), scripts or other devices or means to purchase advertising through LinkedIn Ads is prohibited without LinkedIn's express written permission in each instance. You may not resell or transfer access to LinkedIn Ads to any other party. Your account is for your express use only and not transferable or assignable to anyone else inside or outside your organization.</p>
<h3>Content and Advertising Guidelines:</h3>
<p>Use of LinkedIn Ads is subject to the LinkedIn <a onclick="LI.popup(this.href); return false;" href="/legal/pop/pop-sas-guidelines">Advertising Guidelines</a>. Because we may revise the LinkedIn Advertising Guidelines at any time by posting them to the site, and you will be bound by such revisions, you should visit the page for the LinkedIn Advertising Guidelines from time to time to review the current version.</p>
<p>You agree not to use LinkedIn Ads service for any unlawful purpose, including, without limitation, advertising any product or service that would violate any federal, state, local or foreign laws, regulations, administrative or judicial order.</p>
<p>LinkedIn has the editorial discretion to reject or cease serving any advertisement for any reason at any time, regardless of whether or not such advertisement was previously accepted or served.</p>
<p>You represent and warrant that you have the right to permit LinkedIn to serve the advertisement, including, without limitation, any copyrighted material, trademarks, service marks, logos or slogans; and the use, transmission or display by LinkedIn of the advertisement as authorized herein will not violate the rights of any third parties.</p>
<h3>Targeting:</h3>
<p>LinkedIn Ads advertisements will be shown to LinkedIn members based on non-personally identifiable profile data of the viewing members. This profile data is either provided by the member or algorithmically determined by data provided by the member. LinkedIn does not verify the accuracy of member-generated content on the site and, as such, is not liable for any advertisement that was shown to members based on inaccurate profile data or data algorithmically generated.</p>
<p>Member profile data will never be provided to you through your use of LinkedIn Ads, and you agree that you will not attempt to acquire any such member profile data through any means. Members viewing your advertisement will remain anonymous to you.</p>
<h3>Payment:</h3>
<p>You agree to pay for all fees you incur in connection with each advertisement including any advertisements placed by you on behalf of your employer and regardless of the payment instrument used, and you hereby either: (i) grant LinkedIn the right to regularly charge the credit card you have provided in your account information as means of satisfying the fees you owe; or (ii) agree to pay invoices for the fees you owe net 30 from the date of invoice (to qualify for invoicing, you must spend at least $3,000 per month for two consecutive months and have an established credit history with LinkedIn). LinkedIn may terminate this invoicing ability unilaterally at its discretion.</p>
<p>Payment intervals will be determined by LinkedIn and posted in the Ads information section. Your fees will be owed in the currency indicated by us. Our measurements are the definitive measurements under these terms and conditions for calculating your fees, whether you have elected to pay by impressions (i.e., the number of times the advertisement is displayed to a member) or clicks (i.e., the number of times the advertisement is clicked on by a member). You also are responsible for paying (a) all taxes and government charges that we must levy on your fees for advertising, and (b) reasonable expenses and attorneys fees we incur collecting late amounts.</p>
<p>LinkedIn reserves the right to change which credit cards or invoiced customers it accepts in its sole discretion and (a) you may be required to modify your account to provide a then-acceptable credit card in order to maintain your Ads accounts and (b) your only recourse if you are not satisfied with the then-accepted payment options is to cancel your advertisements, provided that you will nevertheless be responsible for all fees incurred for when your ad ran prior to cancellation.</p>
<p>If LinkedIn charges you an initial one-time fee, it will be applied toward your Ads account and automatically applied toward your future advertising fees.</p>
<p>Amounts you pay pursuant to the Ads service are non-refundable.</p>
<p>LinkedIn reserves the unilateral right to remove any or all active ads if there is an amount owed under this Supplement that is past due by more than fifteen (15) days.</p>
<h3>Cancellation:</h3>
<p>You may cancel your advertisement at any time after its submission by accessing the online Ads service and following the cancellation instructions provided. LinkedIn will endeavor to cease serving your advertisement promptly following your cancellation. You shall be required to pay for those impressions and/or clicks, as applicable, which occur prior to discontinuation of your advertisement.</p>
<h3>Removal of Advertisements by LinkedIn:</h3>
<p>LinkedIn reserves the right to remove any advertisement at any time, with cause due to a violation of LinkedIn.com's User Agreement, LinkedIn's Advertising Guidelines, this Agreement, or any other agreement between you and LinkedIn. As a consequence of your violation of any of the aforementioned agreements, LinkedIn may, at its sole discretion, prohibit you from any further participation in the LinkedIn Ads service and any other service or program offered by LinkedIn, or suspend or remove your LinkedIn account. LinkedIn may undertake technical measures in furtherance of such prohibition.</p>
<p>LinkedIn shall also have the right to remove any advertisement at any time without cause as LinkedIn determines in its sole discretion. LinkedIn is not required to provide you with any explanation for its removal of any advertising and you agree that all of LinkedIn decisions relating to the placement and removal of advertising shall be final and binding.</p>
<p>In addition, your advertisements may be removed if LinkedIn, in its discretion, ceases offering the Ads program.</p>
<p>In the event of any removal of your advertising under this section, you will be responsible for paying for all ads that ran prior to time of removal or cessation.</p>
<h3>No Guarantees:</h3>
<p>LinkedIn does not guarantee the results or distribution of any advertisement in any manner. LinkedIn does not guarantee you any number of impressions (i.e., times your advertisement is viewed by a member) or clicks (i.e., times your advertisement is clicked on by a member) through LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn provides no guarantee or warranty regarding the placement, delivery, timing, or performance of advertisements purchased through LinkedIn Ads. LinkedIn does not screen or attempt to verify the accuracy of any information on the LinkedIn.com site or in the member profiles, and, as such, does not guarantee the identity or personal information of the individuals who will view the advertisements you purchase through LinkedIn Ads.</p>
<h3>Non-Exclusive:</h3>
<p>This contract is not exclusive as to your business, products or services. LinkedIn retains the complete and unqualified right to solicit the business of and advertisements from persons and entities that may be in competition with your business, products or services, as well as to serve its own advertisements that may be in competition with your business, products or services.
You acknowledge that LinkedIn and its affiliates may participate in ad placing auctions to promote its own services or otherwise communicate to its users.

The limitation of liability set forth in the preceding sentence shall:</p>
<ol>
<li>apply regardless of whether you base your claim on contract, tort, statute or any other legal theory, we knew or should have known about the possibility of such damages, or the limited remedies provided herein fail of their essential purpose, and </li>

</ol>
