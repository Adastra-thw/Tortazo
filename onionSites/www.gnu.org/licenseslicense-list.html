<p>We classify a license according to certain key criteria:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whether it qualifies as a
<a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a> license.</li>

<li>Whether it is a <a href="/copyleft/copyleft.html">copyleft</a>
license.</li>

<li>Whether it is
<a href="/licenses/gpl-faq.html#WhatDoesCompatMean">compatible with
the GNU GPL</a>.  Unless otherwise specified, compatible licenses are
compatible with both GPLv2 and GPLv3.</li>

<li>Whether it causes any particular practical problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>We try to list the most commonly encountered free software license on
this page, but cannot list them all; we'll try our best to answer
questions about free software licenses whether or not they are listed
here.  The licenses are more or less in alphabetical order within each
section.</p>

<p>If you believe you have found a violation of one of our licenses,
please refer to our <a href="/licenses/gpl-violation.html">license

<p>If you've started a new project and you're not sure what license to
use, <a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html">&ldquo;How to
choose a license for your own work&rdquo;</a> details our

<p>If you have questions about free software licenses, you can email
us
at <a href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">&lt;licensing@fsf.org&gt;</a>.
Because our resources are limited, we do not answer questions that are
meant to assist proprietary software development or distribution, and
you'll likely get an answer faster if you ask a specific question that
isn't already covered here or in <a href="/licenses/gpl-faq.html">our
FAQ</a>.  We
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/volunteer">welcome knowledgeable

<p>If you are contemplating writing a new license, please also contact
us at <a
href="mailto:licensing@fsf.org">&lt;licensing@fsf.org&gt;</a>. The
proliferation of different free software licenses is a significant
problem in the free software community today, both for users and
developers.  We will do our best to help you find an existing free
software license that meets your needs.</p>

<p>Please note that GPLv2 is, by itself, not compatible with GPLv3.

<p>This is a free software, copyleft license.  Its terms effectively
consist of the terms of GPLv3, with an additional paragraph in section 13
to allow users who interact with the licensed software over a network to
receive the source for that program.  We recommend that developers consider
using the GNU AGPL for any software which will commonly be run over a
network.</p>

<p>Please note that the GNU AGPL is not compatible with GPLv2.  It is
also technically not compatible with GPLv3 in a strict sense: you
cannot take code released under the GNU AGPL and convey or modify it
however you like under the terms of GPLv3, or vice versa.  However,
you are allowed to combine separate modules or source files released
under both of those licenses in a single project, which will provide
many programmers with all the permission they need to make the
programs they want.  See section 13 of both licenses for
details.</p></dd>

<p>This is a lax, permissive free software license, compatible with
the GNU GPL, which we recommend GNU packages use for README and other
small supporting files.  All developers can feel free to use it in
similar situations.</p>

<p>Older versions of this license did not have the second sentence with

<p>Please note that this license is not compatible with GPL version 2,
because it has some requirements that are not in that GPL version.
These include certain patent termination and indemnification
provisions.  The patent termination provision is a good thing, which
is why we recommend the Apache 2.0 license for substantial programs
over other lax permissive licenses.</p></dd>

    Modified BSD license</a>
    <span class="anchor-reference-id">
      (<a href="#ModifiedBSD">#ModifiedBSD</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is the original BSD license, modified by removal of the
advertising clause.  It is a lax, permissive non-copyleft free
software license, compatible with the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>This license is sometimes referred to as the 3-clause BSD license.</p>

<p>The modified BSD license is not bad, as lax permissive licenses go,
though the Apache 2.0 license is preferable.  However, it is risky to
recommend use of &ldquo;the BSD license&rdquo;, even for special cases
such as small programs, because confusion could easily occur and lead
to use of the flawed <a href="#OriginalBSD"><em>original</em> BSD
license</a>.  To avoid this risk, you can suggest the X11 license
instead.  The X11 license and the modified revised BSD license are
more or less equivalent.</p>

<p>However, the Apache 2.0 license is better for substantial programs,
since it prevents patent treachery.</p></dd>

    CC0</a>
    <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#CC0">#CC0</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>CC0 is a public domain dedication from Creative Commons.  A
work released under CC0 is dedicated to the public domain to the
fullest extent permitted by law.  If that is not possible for any
reason, CC0 also provides a lax, permissive license as a fallback.
Both public domain works and the lax license provided by CC0 are
compatible with the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>If you want to release your work to the public domain, we recommend
you use CC0.</p></dd>


<dt><a id="CeCILL" href="http://www.cecill.info/licences.en.html">
    CeCILL version 2</a>
    <span class="anchor-reference-id">(<a href="#CeCILL">#CeCILL</a>)</span>
    </dt>
<dd>
<p>The CeCILL is a free software license, explicitly compatible with the
GNU GPL.</p>

<p>The text of the CeCILL uses a couple of biased terms that ought to be
avoided: <a
href="/philosophy/not-ipr.html">&ldquo;intellectual property&rdquo;</a>
and <a href="/philosophy/words-to-avoid.html#Protection">
&ldquo;protection&rdquo;</a>; this decision
was unfortunate, because reading the license tends to spread the
presuppositions of those terms.  However, this does not cause any
particular problem for the programs released under the CeCILL.</p>

<p>Section 9.4 of the CeCILL commits the program's developers to certain
forms of cooperation with the users, if someone attacks the program
with a patent.  You might look at that as a problem for the developer;
however, if you are sure you would want to cooperate with the users in
those ways anyway, then it isn't a problem for you.</p></dd>

       The Clear BSD License</a>
    <span class="anchor-reference-id">
       (<a href="#clearbsd">#clearbsd</a>)</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This is a free software license, compatible with both GPLv2 and
GPLv3.  It is based on the <a href="#ModifiedBSD">modified BSD
license</a>, and adds a term expressly stating it does not grant you
any patent licenses.  Because of this, we encourage you to be careful
about using software under this license; you should first consider
whether the licensor might want to sue you for patent infringement.
If the developer is refusing users patent licenses to set up a trap
for you, it would be wise to avoid the program.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>This license covers the European Computer Modern Fonts and Text
Companion Fonts, commonly used with LaTeX.  Depending on how it is
used, it may be free or not.  If the package says that some fonts in
the package may not be modified, then the package is nonfree.
Otherwise the package is free.  The original fonts have no
restrictions on modification, so they are free.</p>

<p>Much like <a href="#LPPL-1.2">the LaTeX Project Public
License 1.2</a>, this license requires modified versions of the work
to use a name that's different from the name of any prior version.
This is acceptable for work meant to be used with LaTeX, since TeX
allows you to create filename mappings for your programs, but it's
very annoying and could be overly burdensome in other contexts.</p>

<p>An &ldquo;informal license&rdquo; means a statement such as
&ldquo;do whatever you like with this&rdquo; or &ldquo;you can
redistribute this code and change it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the United States, these licenses are supposed to be interpreted
based on what the author seems to intend.  So they probably mean what
they appear to mean.  That would make them non-copyleft free software
licenses and compatible with the GNU GPL.  However, an unlucky choice
of wording could give it a different meaning.</p>

<p>However, many other countries have a more rigid approach to
copyright licenses.  There is no telling what courts in those
countries might decide an informal statement means.  Courts might
even decide that it is not a license at all.</p>

<p>If you want your code to be free, don't invite gratuitous trouble
for your users.  Please choose and apply an established free software
license.  We offer <a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html">
recommendations</a> that we suggest you follow.</p></dd>

<p>This license is sometimes also known as the OpenBSD License.  It is a

<p>This license does have an unfortunate wording choice: it provides
recipients with &quot;Permission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute
this software&hellip;&quot; This is roughly the same language from the
license of Pine that the University of Washington later claimed
prohibited people from distributing modified versions of the
software.</p>

<p>ISC has told us they do not share the University of Washington's
interpretation, and we have every reason to believe them.  Thus, there's
no reason to avoid software released under this license.  However, to

<dd>
<p>This is a free software license.  Section 3.3 provides indirect
compatibility between this license and the GNU GPL version 2.0, the
GNU LGPL version 2.1, the GNU AGPL version 3.0, and all later versions
of those licenses.  When you receive work under MPL 2.0,
you may make a &ldquo;Larger Work&rdquo; that combines that work with
work under those GNU licenses.  When you do, section 3.3 gives
you permission to distribute the MPL-covered work under the terms of
the same GNU licenses, with one condition: you must make sure that the
files that were originally under the MPL are still available under the
MPL's terms as well.  In other words, when you make a combination this
way, the files that were originally under the MPL will be dual
licensed under the MPL and the GNU license(s).  The end result is that
the Larger Work, as a whole, will be covered under the GNU license(s).
People who receive that combination from you will have the option to
use any files that were originally covered by the MPL under that
license's terms, or distribute the Larger Work in whole or in part
under the GNU licenses' terms with no further restrictions.</p>

<p>It's important to understand that the condition to distribute files
under the MPL's terms only applies to the party that first creates and
distributes the Larger Work.  If it applied to their recipients as well, it
would be a further restriction and incompatible with the GPL and AGPL.
That said, when you make contributions to an existing project, we usually
<a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html#contributing">recommend that you keep your changes under the same license</a>,
even when you're not required to do so.  If you receive a work under a GNU
license where some files are also under the MPL, you should only remove the
MPL from those files when there's a strong reason to justify it.</p>

<p>Check the license notices on the MPL-covered software before you make
a Larger Work this way.  Parties who release original work under
MPL 2.0 may choose to opt out of this compatibility by
including a sentence in the license notices that says that the work is
&ldquo;Incompatible With Secondary Licenses.&rdquo; Any software that
includes this notice is <strong>not</strong> compatible with the GPL
or AGPL.</p>

<p>Software under previous versions of the MPL can be upgraded to version
2.0, but any software that isn't already available under one of the
listed GNU licenses <strong>must</strong> be marked as Incompatible With Secondary
Licenses.  This means that software that's only available under
previous versions of the MPL is still incompatible with the GPL and AGPL.</p>

<dd>
<p>This is a free software license.  By itself, it has a copyleft
comparable to the GPL's, and incompatible with it.  However, it gives
recipients ways to relicense the work under the terms of other
selected licenses, and some of those&mdash;the <a href="#EPL">Eclipse
Public License</a> and the <a href="#CommonPublicLicense10">Common
Public License</a> in particular&mdash;only provide a weaker copyleft.
Thus, developers can't rely on this license to provide a strong
copyleft.</p>

<p>The EUPL allows relicensing to GPLv2, because that is listed as one
of the alternative licenses that users may convert to.  It also,
indirectly, allows relicensing to GPL version 3, because there is a
way to relicense to the CeCILL v2, and the CeCILL v2 gives a way to
relicense to any version of the GNU GPL.</p>

<p>To do this two-step relicensing, you need to first write a piece of
code which you can license under the CeCILL v2, or find a
suitable module already available that way, and add it to the
program.  Adding that code to the EUPL-covered program provides
grounds to relicense it to the CeCILL v2.  Then you need to write a
piece of code which you can license under the GPLv3+, or find a
suitable module already available that way, and add it to the program.
Adding that code to the CeCILL-covered program provides grounds to
relicense it to GPLv3+.</p></dd>

<dd>
<p>This license is an incomplete statement of the distribution terms
for LaTeX.  As far as it goes, it is a free software license, but
incompatible with the <a
href="/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a> because it has
many requirements that are not in the GPL.</p>

<p>This license contains complex and annoying restrictions on how to
publish a modified version, including one requirement that falls just
barely on the good side of the line of what is acceptable: that any
modified file must have a new name.</p>

<p>The reason this requirement is acceptable for LaTeX is that TeX has
a facility to allow you to map file names, to specify &ldquo;use file
bar when file foo is requested&rdquo;.  With this facility, the
requirement is merely annoying; without the facility, the same
requirement would be a serious obstacle, and we would have to conclude
it makes the program nonfree.</p>

<p>This condition may cause trouble with some major modifications.
For example, if you wanted to port an LPPL-covered work to another
system that lacked a similar remapping facility, but still required
users to request this file by name, you would need to implement a
remapping facility too to keep this software free.  That would be a
nuisance, but the fact that a license would make code nonfree if
transplanted into a very different context does not make it nonfree in
the original context.</p>

<p>The LPPL says that some files, in certain versions of LaTeX, may have
additional restrictions, which could render them nonfree.  For this
reason, it may take some careful checking to produce a version of
LaTeX that is free software.</p>

<p>The LPPL makes the controversial claim that simply having files on a
machine where a few other people could log in and access them in
itself constitutes distribution.  We believe courts would not uphold
this claim, but it is not good for people to start making the claim.</p>

<p>Please do not use this license for any other project.</p>

<p>Note: These comments are for version 1.2 (3 Sep 1999) of the LPPL.</p></dd>

<p>The Open Software License is a free software license.  It is
incompatible with the GNU GPL in several ways.</p>

<p><a id="OSLRant"></a>Recent versions of the Open Software License have
a term which requires distributors to try to obtain explicit assent to

of the license and would subject you to possible termination of the

<p><strong>The following licenses <em>do not qualify</em> as <a
href="/philosophy/free-sw.html">free software</a>
licenses.  A nonfree license is automatically incompatible with the <a
href="#GNUGPL">GNU GPL</a>.</strong></p>

<p>Of course, we urge you to avoid using nonfree software licenses, and
to avoid nonfree software in general.</p>

<p>There is no way we could list all the known nonfree software
licenses here; after all, every proprietary software company has its
own.  We focus here on licenses that are often mistaken for free
software licenses but are, in fact, <strong>not</strong> free software
licenses.</p>

<p>We have provided links to these licenses when we can do so without
violating our general policy: that we do not make links to sites that
promote, encourage or facilitate the use of nonfree software packages.
The last thing we want to do is give any nonfree program some gratis
publicity that might encourage more people to use it.  For the same
reason, we have avoided naming the programs for which a license is used,
unless we think that for specific reasons it won't backfire.</p>

<dd>
<p>If source code does not carry a license to give users the four
essential freedoms, then unless it has been explicitly and validly
placed in the public domain, it is not free software.</p>

<p>Some developers think that code with no license is
automatically <a href="#PublicDomain">in the public domain</a>.  That
is not true under today's copyright law; rather, all copyrightable
works are copyrighted by default.  This includes programs.  Absent a
license to grant users freedom, they don't have any.  In some
countries, users that download code with no license may infringe
copyright merely by compiling it or running it.</p>

<p>In order for a program to be free, its copyright holders must
explicitly grant users the <a href="/philosophy/free-sw.html"> four
essential freedoms</a>.  The document with which they do so is called
a <em>free software license</em>.  This is what free software
licenses are for.</p>

<p>Some countries allow authors to put code in the public domain, but
that requires explicit action.  If you wish to do that, the method we
recommend is to use <a href="#CC0">CC0</a>, which also works in other
countries by putting on a license that is more or less equivalent to
public domain.  However, in most cases it
is <a href="/licenses/license-recommendations.html"> better to
copyleft your code</a> to assure that freedom reaches all users of the
code.</p>

<p>Code written by employees of the US government is a special
exception, since US copyright law explicitly puts that in the public
domain; but this does not apply to works that the US pays a company to
write.  It also does not apply to other countries, many of which do
allow the state to have a copyright on government writings.</p>

<p>The AT&amp;T Public License is a nonfree license.  It has several
serious problems:</p>

<ol>
<li>The patent license is voided by any modification, no matter how
small, of the pertinent code.</li>
<li>You must demand a written agreement when you distribute the
sources or patches.</li>
<li>It requires notifying AT&amp;T if you distribute a patch.</li>
<li>Your license can be terminated through no fault of yours, under
section 8/3.</li>
<li>It makes compliance with export control laws a condition
of the license.</li>
<li>Some versions of the license require you to provide support.</li>
<li>Some versions of the license say you cannot sell a copy of the
software for more than the expense of distribution.</li>
</ol>

<p>The license has two other obnoxious features:</p>
<ol>
<li>It has a very broad reverse license to AT&amp;T, which goes far beyond
the use of your code, even your code modified.</li>
<li>It asserts one needs a license from AT&amp;T to make a link to their
web site.  This is not an immediate practical problem, since the
license says it gives permission to make such a link.  (Anyway, people
shouldn't make links to sites about nonfree software.)  But such
a claim should not be made or propagated.</li>

make your manual free, someone else might decide to imitate you, then
change his or her mind about the options thinking that that is just a
detail; the result would be that his or her manual is nonfree.</p>

<p>Thus, while manuals published under this license do qualify as free
documentation if neither license option was used, it is better to use the
GNU Free Documentation License and avoid the risk of leading someone else
astray.</p>

<p>Please note that this license is not the same as the <a
href="#OCL">Open Content License</a>.  These two licenses are frequently
confused, as the Open Content License is often referred to as the
&ldquo;OPL&rdquo;.  For clarity, it is better not to use the
abbreviation &ldquo;OPL&rdquo; for either license.  It is worth spelling
their names in full to make sure people understand what you say.</p></dd>

Creative Commons publishes many licenses which are
very different.  Therefore, to say that a work &ldquo;uses a Creative
Commons license&rdquo; is to leave the principal questions about the
work's licensing unanswered.  When you see such a statement in a work,
please ask the author to change the work to state clearly and
visibly <em>which</em>of the Creative Commons license it uses.  And if
someone proposes to &ldquo;use a Creative Commons license&rdquo; for a
certain work, it is vital to ask &ldquo;Which Creative Commons
license?&rdquo; before proceeding any further.</p></dd>

<p>The licenses below apply to an instantiation of a design in a computer

a design is always copyrightable.  The legal status of the artistic
design is complex, and varies by jurisdiction.</p>

<p>The GNU GPL <strong>can</strong> be used for fonts.  However, note

<p>The Open Font License (including its original release, version 1.0)
is a free copyleft license for fonts.  Its only unusual requirement is
that fonts be distributed with some computer program, rather than alone.
Since a simple Hello World program will satisfy the requirement, it is
harmless.  Neither we nor SIL recommend the use of this license for
anything other than fonts.</p></dd>

<p>Works that express someone's opinion&mdash;memoirs, editorials, and
so on&mdash;serve a fundamentally different purpose than works for
practical use like software and documentation.  Because of this, we
expect them to provide recipients with a different set of permissions:
just the permission to copy and distribute the work verbatim.

 for works of opinion">Richard Stallman discusses this</a> frequently
in his speeches.</p>

<p>Because so many licenses meet these criteria, we cannot list them
all.  If you are looking for one to use yourself, however, there are
two that we recommend:</p>
