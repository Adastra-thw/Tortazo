It's important to define your advertising goals before launching your campaign. A clear goal will guide you as you create your ads, target the right audience, and choose the best destination landing page. For example,<br><br>
                     

                        	<b>A</b>. If your goal is <b>to generate clicks</b> to your website at a certain cost per click (CPC), use the <i>My Ad Campaigns tab</i> and <i>Reporting tab</i> in  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/ads/home?src=en-all-el-li-tracking_results&trk=tracking_results&utm_medium=el&utm_source=li&utm_campaign=tracking_results">LinkedIn Ads</a> to track your progress. You can track the number of clicks you've received against your total budget spent.<br><br>
                        	<b>B</b>. If your ultimate goal is <b>to generate leads, inquiries, or sales</b> that result from the clicks that you receive, you need to track users’ actions on your website and attribute those actions to your ads on LinkedIn. The most common way to do this is to use reports from a website analytics tool. Free website analytics solutions like <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/">Google Analytics</a> can be configured within a few hours to provide key insights such as the number of conversions (actions of visitors on your site) and conversion rate (the percent of visitors) from a source like LinkedIn Ads that result in an action). <a href="http://www.google.com/analytics/tour.html">Watch a video tour</a> of Google Analytics to learn more.<br>
                       <p class="bodytext">
                       With these measures in hand, you can estimate the number of clicks that you'll need to achieve your business objectives.
                       </p>
                                            
                       
                       </p>
                        <p class="toplink" align="right"><a href="#">Start of page</a></p> 
                        <p class="bodyhead"><a name="roi">2. Evaluate your return on investment (ROI)</a></p>

To evaluate your overall campaign performance, let’s understand how many clicks resulted in actual customers.
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Here's a hypothetical example: Nina is the VP of Marketing at an accounting software company. Her goal is to get VPs of Finance departments at mid-size companies to complete a "Contact Us" form on her website. Her sales team will follow up on those leads. In general, 1 out of every 10 leads becomes a paying customer. A new customer is worth $600 to Nina's business, so she's willing to spend up to $60 for each lead.
</p>
<p class="exampletext">
Advertising Goal: $60 cost per lead<br>
Campaign Length: 30 days<br>
Campaign Budget: $1,000
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
At the end of her campaign, Nina observes the following results from her <i>My Ad Campaign</i> tab in LinkedIn Ads:
</p>
<p class="exampletext">
Clicks: 400<br>
Ave. Cost per click (CPC): $2.50<br>
Total Spend: $1,000<br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
Using her web analytics reports, Nina can see the following:
</p>
<p class="exampletext">
Clicks: 400 (# of visits resulting from her ads on LinkedIn)<br>
Leads: 40 conversions (# of visitors completed her "Contact Us" form after clicking on an ad)<br>
Conversion rate: 10% (percent of visitors that became a lead)<br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext">
To evaluate the ROI, Nina compares how much she spent with the results:
</p>
<p class="exampletext">
Total Cost: $1,000<br>
Cost per Lead: $25<br><br>

Profit: $2,400<br>
New Customers: 4 (10% of those leads became customers after being contacted by her sales team)<br>
</p>
<p class="bodytext"><b>Conclusion</b>: Nina was able to pay $1,000 to receive 400 clicks, resulting in 4 new customers that were worth $2,400 to her business. A 140% ROI!
</p>

<b>A</b>. If your goal is <b>to generate more clicks</b> at a reduced cost per click (CPC):

	<ul>
		<li><b>Test multiple ad variations</b>. One of the easiest ways to get more clicks and reduce your average CPC is to improve the click-through rate (CTR) of your ad. In general, the higher the CTR, the lower the CPC you'll need to bid to receive impressions and clicks. The best way to increase the CTR is to test multiple variations of ad text and images. Get some ideas for <a href="Ads_bestpractices_en_US.html#multiple">types of ad variations that you can test</a>.</li>
	</ul>

						</p>
						<p class="bodytext">

<b>B</b>. If your goal is <b>to generate more leads, inquiries, or sales</b> without increasing your advertising costs:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Target the right geography</b>. Make sure that you've selected the right target geography so that your ads are shown only to people in the regions that you do business in. If your product is available only in the United Kingdom, you don't want to display your ads to people in the United States.</li>
		<li><b>Refine your target audience</b>. Picture your ideal customers. Are there any job functions (like Marketing or Finance) or industries (like Pharmaceuticals or Telecommunications) that you can use to narrow your audience further? LinkedIn Ads targeting is based on information supplied by LinkedIn members, so make sure you've selected the targeting options that fit your prospective customers. <a href="Ads_bestpractices_en_US.html#target">Read more about targeting</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Pick the right landing page</b>. The landing page is the page that people visit when they click on your ad. The information on that page should be related to the products, services, or events that are mentioned in your ad. If people can't easily find what they're looking for, they'll quickly leave.</li>
		<li><b>Fine tune your landing page</b>. Your quality of your landing page and website ultimately determine how often people who click on your ads take the desired actions. Here are a few tips for creating the best landing page:
			<ul>
				<li>Customize your page and special offers for your target audience. For example, 10% off for LinkedIn members.</li>
				<li>Offer relevant and useful information that you've mentioned in your ad to give users a reason to stay and take action.</li>
				<li>Keep things simple. Don't clutter your page with too much text, images, or competing messages.</li>
			</ul>		
		</li>
	</ul>

						</p>
						<p class="bodytext">
						
<b>C</b>. If your goal is <b>to generate more awareness</b> for your products or brand and you are not as concerned about the number of people clicking on your ad:

	<ul>
		<li><b>Be visual</b>. Make sure that your ads include images that portray your products or services well. Your image should use the entire 50x50 pixel space effectively. <a href="Ads_bestpractices_en_US.html#ads">Read more about creating effective ads</a>.</li>
		<li><b>Pay by CPM</b>. By setting a CPM or cost per 1,000 impressions bid, you will be paying each time your ad is shown 1,000 times. In general, advertisers with awareness as a goal are more successful with CPM style of bidding.</li>
	</ul>
