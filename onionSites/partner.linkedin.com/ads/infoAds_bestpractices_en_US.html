                        	<li><b>Include an image</b> with your ad that's relevant to what you offer. The LinkedIn background color is white, so images with bright colors are more likely to capture the attention of your audience.The maximum size of the image is 50 pixels wide by 50 pixels high, so be sure that the contents of your image are readable at this size.</li>
                        	<li>Review the <a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=pop/pop_sas_guidelines">advertising guidelines</a> for details on what's acceptable to include in your ad.</li>

Your account is organized by campaigns. Each campaign you create has its own daily budget, targeting options, and ads. Within your campaign, <b>create at least 3 ad variations</b> -- varying the ad text, call-to-action phrases, and images. You can create up to 15 different ads within a campaign. By creating multiple ads, you can discover which ads perform best.<br><br>

<b>How it works</b>: Initially, all of the ads that you create will be displayed to your selected target audience. As you start receiving clicks, the ad that performs the best as measured by CTR will be shown more often and receive more clicks. Note that you can also set your campaign to rotate ad variations more evenly. With that setting, each ad will receive the same number of impressions. Pause the ads that have the lowest CTR and experiment with new variations to find ads that have a higher CTR.<br><br>

Narrow your target audience to people who may be interested in what you offer. Make sure to create ads that <b>resonate with that particular audience</b>. Here are some suggestions for how to use the most common targeting options:<br><br>

<b>Geography</b><br>
Choose one or more geographies for your campaign, especially if your products or services only appeal to users in certain countries or cities. If you narrow your audience to the city level, note that this will decrease your target audience dramatically.<br><br>

<b>Industry</b><br>
Target by categories of companies (also known as Industry) if you're trying to reach people of various job function within an industry. Examples of industries: Banking, Real Estate, Internet, and Automotive. <b>Tip</b>: If industries respond better to ad text written just for that industry, create separate campaigns for each industry that you're targeting.<br><br>

<b>Job Function</b><br>
Target by job function if you want to limit your ads to people who are in one of 20 broad job functions. If your offering appeals to multiple job functions, consider creating a campaign for each function so that you can tailor your ads to each function. If job function is not specific enough, target by exact job titles and customize your ad text for those people.<br><br>

Example job functions:<br>
	<ul>
   		<li><b>Academics</b>: Includes teachers, professors, and science researchers</li>
   		<li><b>Administrative</b>: Includes admin. assistants and program/project management </li>
   		<li><b>Creative</b>: Includes artists, designers, musicians, writers, and journalists</li>
   		<li><b>Engineering</b>: Includes engineers, developers, architects, and quality assurance </li>
   		<li><b>Finance</b>: Includes bankers, investment managers, financial advisors, and insurance agents</li>
   		<li><b>Information Technology</b>: Includes IT workers, system and database administrators</li>
   		<li><b>Marketing</b>: Includes advertising and marketing professionals, market researchers</li>
   		<li><b>Operations</b>: Includes operations roles, logistics professionals, facility managers, and manufacturing roles</li>
    </ul>

Your <b>Daily Budget</b> is the maximum amount that you are willing to spend each day. We display your ads at <b>different rates during the day</b> depending on when LinkedIn users are active on the website -- for example, 50% of your budget might be spent in the morning, 30% in the afternoon, and 20% overnight. Once your Daily Budget is reached, your ads will stop showing for that day. Also, note that since <b>most people visit LinkedIn on weekdays</b>, you're more likely to spend your Daily Budget during the week than over the weekend.<br><br>

Note that an advertising "day" is based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwich_Mean_Time">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</a>, which starts at 4pm Pacific (7pm Eastern) in the U.S.<br><br>

If you're not receiving as many impressions and clicks as you'd like, this could be because your Daily Budget is too low. If your campaign is constrained by budget, we may show your ads evenly across the day, so that you don't receive all impressions and clicks in the morning. Check to see if you are budget constrained by calculating the average total spend per day for a recent time period (Last 7 Days) and comparing that amount to your Daily Budget. If your total spend per day is equal or close to your Daily Budget and you'd like to receive more impressions and clicks, increase your Daily Budget.<br>

                        <p class="bodytext">
For each campaign, you set a payment method: Pay per click (CPC) or Pay per Impressions (CPM). You also set a bid, the maximum you're willing to pay for a click or for 1,000 impressions.<br><br>

If you're just getting started with LinkedIn Ads, we suggest that you enter a bid that's within the <b>Suggested Bid Range</b>. The <b>Suggested Bid Range</b> is an estimate of the current competing bids by other advertisers. The higher your bid within the range, the more likely it is for your ad to be shown and receive clicks.<br><br>

<b>Note</b>: Each click will cost between <b>$2.00</b> (the minimum cost per click) and <b>your bid</b>.<br><br>

<b>How it works</b>: You set a bid for each of your campaigns. A real-time auction is run each time a LinkedIn user visits a page that contains an ad unit. If the user falls into your targeting options, your ad will be entered into this auction along with the bids of other advertisers. If you do not enter a bid within the suggested range, your ad will be less likely to beat other advertisers' bids in the auction, resulting in fewer or no impressions or clicks. Remember that the bid you choose is the maximum you're willing to pay, and we will discount your click or impression so that you're only paying the minimum necessary to beat the advertiser below you.<br><br>

<b>Ad performance</b><br><br>
Your <b>click-through rate (CTR)</b> is a good indicator of how your ad is performing. In general, <b>good ads have a CTR greater than 0.025%</b>.<br><br>

<b>Important</b>: Monitor your ad's click-through rate (CTR) on a regular basis. If the CTR of your ad drops, refresh the ads with new images or ad text. A good practice is to refresh your ads <b>at least once per month</b>.<br><br>

If your CTR is lower than 0.025%, create and test several additional ad variations by following the suggestions for creating great ads listed above. With small changes to your ads, you can improve the click-though rate significantly. You can test up to 15 different ads within a single campaign. You can also try narrowing your target audience so that your ad becomes more relevant and will receive more clicks.<br><br>

<b>Campaign performance</b><br><br>
If you want to <b>get more impressions and clicks</b>, improve the CTR of your ads by experimenting with different ad variations that target specific audiences. One way to do this: Break each of your campaigns (for example, targeting 900,000 members) into multiple 3 smaller campaigns (targeting 300,000 members each), and write ads specifically with those smaller audiences in mind. Note: A common mistake is to increase the audience size of your campaign; in most cases, expanding your audience will result in a lower CTR and fewer impressions and clicks.<br><br>

If you want to <b>get more leads or inquiries</b>, make sure that your ad is relevant to what you offer and is attractive to the audience that you are targeting. Optimize your landing page to give people the information they're looking for and an easy way to complete the action you'd like them to take. If possible, try special offers or free trials of your products or services.<br><br>

If you want to <b>reduce the cost per click</b>, improve the CTR of your ads by experimenting with different headlines, images, and descriptions. Turn off ad variations that aren't performing well. Another way to reduce your cost per click is to reduce your maximum bid. However, note that a bid that's below the Suggested Bid Range may result in few or no clicks.
