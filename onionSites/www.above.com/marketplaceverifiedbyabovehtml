<b>Max Bids and Automated Bidding</b>

<p>The Max Bid value is the maximum amount that you are willing to pay for each domain.<br />
Note: No other bidder will be able to see your Max Bid.</p>

<p>An automated bidding system will place bids for you up to your maximum.<br />
The system will bid the MINIMUM amount needed for you to win the domain name.</p>

<p>If the auction has a reserve price, an automatic bid will be placed up to the value of the reserve or the value of your max bid, whichever is lower.</p>

<p><strong>Example:</strong></p> 

<p>Frank places a $15 max bid on a domain name with a $10 reserve price.<br />
An automatic bid will be placed on the domain for $10 and Frank will be the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Rick enters the auction and places a $20 max bid. The system will bid $16 for Rick, which is the minimum amount needed for Rick to win the auction.  If Frank does not increase his Max Bid, Rick wins the auction for $16.</p>

<p><strong>Extending Auction Times</strong></p>

<p>If the Max Bid of the highest bidder is beaten in the last few minutes of an auction, the auction will be extended by a few minutes.  If the last bid is higher than the current bid, but does not beat the Max Bid of the current highest bidder, the auction time will not be extended.</p>

<p>All bids 10% above the current bid, or over $500, placed in the closing minutes of an auction will always extend the auction time.</p>

<p>Above.com offers a guarantee that Traffic and Revenue statistics reported by the seller for a domain are accurate.</p>

<p>At Above.com we download stats from various parking companies and we collect our own internal traffic stats. This means that the historical traffic reported for domains in the auction interface are exactly as recorded, so we can verify and guarantee that the stats reported are REAL.</p>

<p>However someone could in theory redirect the traffic from one domain to another or use some other artificial means to increase the traffic.
So all we can guarantee is that the historical traffic reported in the auction interface are exactly as reported by parking companies and recorded by us on our servers.</p>
