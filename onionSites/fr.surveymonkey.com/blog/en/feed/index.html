				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en">SurveyMonkey Blog</a></p>
<img width="215" height="215" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/default_tips.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Get Survey Feedback You Care About Most &#8211; Delivered Straight to Your Inbox" title="Get Survey Feedback You Care About Most &#8211; Delivered Straight to Your Inbox" style="float:left;" /> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-21651" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/default_tips.png" alt="Survey Tips!" width="300" height="300" />You’ve sat down with your team and finalized your <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/customer-satisfaction-surveys/" class="liinternal">customer satisfaction survey</a></b>. It’s perfect. You send it out and a week later log in to see the results.</p>
<p>A customer specifically asked for a manager to contact them to resolve an event, but now several days have passed. Yikes! This delay could’ve been avoided if only someone knew that a customer requested attention. So how can you notify a manager ASAP in the future to prevent this from happening again?</p>
<p>This is when our good friend and partner, <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2013/08/20/surveymonkey-zapier/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">Zapier</a></b>, comes in handy. Zapier allows you to link your SurveyMonkey account to dozens of web applications without needing a coding or developer background.</p>
<p>In this case, you could make sure your manager knows about customer requests through email alerts linked to certain survey responses. All you need to do is use Zapier to &#8220;zap&#8221; those responses into your Gmail account. Here&#8217;s how to link your survey to your Gmail account in 5 easy steps:</p>
<h4>Step One: Pick What You Want to Happen</h4>
<p>When you log in to your Zapier account, begin your zap by selecting <b>SurveyMonkey</b> as the trigger. Pick <b>Gmail</b> from the second column, then choose <strong>Send Email</strong> below. Here’s what it’ll look like:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27693 size-full" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-07-at-8.45.39-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-07 at 8.45.39 AM" width="570" height="163" /></p>
<h4>Step Two: Connect Your Accounts</h4>
<p>The next steps walk you through connecting your Zapier profile to your SurveyMonkey and Gmail accounts. This is all done within the Zapier interface, so no need to jump between browser windows.</p>
<h4>Step Three: Decide When an Email Should Be Sent</h4>
<p>Once this is complete, you’ll pick the survey that you want notifications from. The key is to add a custom filter directly below here because this is how to make sure you only get an email when a manager’s attention is requested.</p>
<p>After you’ve tested the survey out, choose the question from the left column and then use the next two fields to specify what answer choice you want to be told about. This is what the the custom filter looks like for the question “Would you like to speak with a manager to follow up on this issue?” with a “Yes” answer:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27694 size-full" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Screen-Shot-2014-08-07-at-8.47.19-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-08-07 at 8.47.19 AM" width="567" height="186" /></p>
<h4>Step Four: Design Your Email</h4>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to denote who gets the email (your manager, in this case), the subject line, and even place the text of what the customer wants to discuss in the message body. (Hint: click on the <strong>Insert Fields </strong>button on the right to do so.)</p>
<h4>Step Five: Test the Zap and Enable It</h4>
<p>Test out your zap, and click the final orange <b>Turn Zap On</b> button at the bottom. You’re now all set to handle your customers’ needs for a little extra assistance when they require it, without combing through your survey responses daily.</p>
<p>The possibilities are pretty endless in Zapier. Would you prefer to handle this scenario with your organization&#8217;s <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2013/12/10/zendesk-surveymonkey/" class="liinternal"><strong>Zendesk</strong> </a>platform? Not a problem! You can create a new ticket in Zendesk when a survey response is submitted. You aren’t limited to email notifications or support tickets either. If you&#8217;re using SurveyMonkey to gather emails for your organization&#8217;s newsletter, you can  set up a zap to create a new contact in your <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2012/02/08/put-a-survey-on-it-our-revamped-mailchimp-integration/" class="liinternal">MailChimp</a></b> list when someone enters their email into your survey.</p>
<p>Now that you have a glimpse into what’s possible, stop by <b><a href="https://zapier.com/zapbook/surveymonkey/zapier/" class="liinternal">Zapier</a> </b>to see how you can automate your tasks to make better decisions, faster.</p>

<p>At <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/lp/audience/insights-request/?utm_source=email&amp;utm_content=trends-tracker&amp;recent=email&amp;program=Q3_14_July_Trends_Tracker_Health" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey Audience</a>, we’re big on data. With millions of consumers ready to take surveys, we’re in a unique position to take the pulse of the American public on a large range of issues. That’s why we’ve teamed up with <a href="http://www.blueshiftideas.com/" target="_blank" class="liexternal">Blueshift Research</a>, an investment research firm, to track how shifting opinions and behavior are shaping the American marketplace.</p>
<p>With our Trends Tracker, businesses and investors can stay in front of developments that might make the difference between big wins and big losses. For our first consumer trends survey, we surveyed 1,087 US consumers on 20 topics, including voting, home buying, technology, TV services, drug laws, and medical robots. Blueshift Research analyzed the data and wrote up their findings on how these trends affect businesses and investors.</p>

<p>So, what&#8217;s in the report? Here are five highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Cable TV vs. the Internet:</b> 1.2% of respondents abandoned Cable TV in July. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/H5Phb" class="liexternal">Tweet this</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Marijuana Legalization:</b> 42% of Americans support the full legalization of marijuana. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/5Be68" class="liexternal">Tweet this</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Residential Solar Power:</b> Low income families are the most likely to adopt solar power in the next six months. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/_xfjf" class="liexternal">Tweet this</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Genetically Modified Foods:</b> Half of respondents oppose GMOs. 82% want them labeled. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/02eaD" class="liexternal">Tweet this</a>.)</li>
<li><b>Healthy Eating:</b> 71% of adults are trying to eat healthier at restaurants than they did two years ago. (<a href="http://ctt.ec/fbDc9" class="liexternal">Tweet this</a>.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&#8217;s a deeper look at the month&#8217;s biggest consumer trend. To see all our findings, <a href="http://smaudience.surveymonkey.com/rs/surveymonkey/images/blueshift-trends-tracker-july-2014.pdf" class="lipdf">download the report</a>.</p>
<h3><b>This month’s biggest trend: Healthy living habit are disrupting the food industry</b></h3>
<p>The food industry is poised for a major shift as increased focus on healthy living habits are changing consumer behavior. Over the past six months, more than three times the number of consumers report improved living habits compared to those whose attention to healthy has decreased. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27482" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chart_Q15_140725.png" alt="healthy-habits" width="650" height="558" /> As a result, demand for healthy dishes and fresh ingredients is on the rise&#8212;threatening fast food companies that don’t adapt their menus to include healthier choices. This trend is also rewarding chains like Chipotle, whose long-standing approach to having a healthier menu is fueling rapid growth. Part of this shift in consumers&#8217; healthy living habits is the desire for genetically modified organism (GMO) foods to be labeled and the refusal to purchase GMO products. About half of respondents oppose GMO foods, and 82% want GMO foods labeled. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-27483" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Chart_Q4_140725.png" alt="gmo-foods" width="650" height="504" /> And if you think this trend only exists among young people, you’d be wrong. Respondents aged 60 and older proved to be more opposed to GMO foods than their younger counterparts. More surprisingly, wealthy households are not leading this trend. Conventional wisdom would suggest that high prices of organic foods would discourage lower income households from purchasing non-GMO foods, but our survey says the opposite. Households with incomes lower than $100,000 were more likely to buy non-GMO products than households making more than $100,000.</p>
<p>Blueshift Research predicts that companies that have enacted (or are in the process of enacting) GMO bans will be the biggest winners from this developing trend, which include Whole Foods, General Mills, and Chipotle. Conversely, biotechnology companies that produce GMO seeds are expected to suffer as demand rises for organic foods. But we’ve only touched the tip of the iceberg with this trend.</p>

But as a business grows, consistently providing top-notch customer service can be difficult and expensive. While nothing beats good support from an actual human, using content strategically can make it a lot easier to scale your efforts—and focus more resources in other areas.</p>
<p>But how do you identify the right issues to address? How do you get that content to customers when they need it? And how should you craft your content to make sure it really helps? A <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/fred.zimny/the-cost-of-poor-customer-service-the-economic-impact-of-customer-experience-in-the-us" class="liexternal">study by Geneysis</a>  found that 65% of customers have ended relationships due to poor customer service. Indeed, stakes are high when you try to replace or augment the human call centers people prefer:</p>

<p>You have to walk a fine line to use content to bolster your customer service efforts. We talked to seven online content experts to outline a simple process for making sure your support content keeps your customers happy while you keep an eye on the bottom line. And here&#8217;s what they said.</p>
<h4>Step 1: Show customers the ropes</h4>
<p>Setting the right expectations from the outset is key. When you market your product or service, you make a lot of promises to your customer&#8211;and you need to deliver. If you overpromise and underdeliver, you’ll wind up with issues no customer support team can fix. But you can also run into problems if customers simply have a hard getting up to speed or using your product the way it&#8217;s intended.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our internal research has shown that the biggest predictor of customer happiness happens before the customer even meets the customer support person,” says Larry Kim, Founder and CTO of <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/" class="liexternal">Wordstream</a>, an online advertising startup. “A key to scaling customer support is simply to avoid relationship-killing client onboarding mistakes that you’ll never recover from.</p>
<p>An easy fix? Give customers an orientation, detailed user guide, or product walkthrough when they first get started with you. This extra step will give you an opportunity to get in front of common problems, but it will also help customers understand (and take advantage of) all the benefits they’ll get from their relationship with you.</p>
<h4>Step 2: Keep tabs on support issues</h4>
<p>It all starts with your support team, according to Zeph Snapp, CEO and Founder <a href="http://www.alturainteractive.com" class="liexternal">Altura Interactive</a>, a Spanish language digital marketing firm.</p>
<blockquote><p>We use customer service queries to inform the content calendar. When some people are describing a problem or frustration, there are probably others doing the same on search engines. We want to make sure we head these queries off at the pass. That way we can control the conversation, instead of getting a negative review.</p></blockquote>
<p>Support teams typically keep a log of issues they deal with. These logs often influence product enhancements and messaging, but your content should also reflect what you learn. From publishing FAQs to knowing what needs to go in your onboarding guide, your support team knows what customers want. Identifying and addressing common issues is the perfect place to start.</p>
<h4>Step 3: Give customers a voice</h4>
<p>You also need to be able to identify and anticipate potential issues. Soliciting customer feedback is a smart way to let customers tell you what they&#8217;re experiencing says Tommy Walker, Head Editor of the <a href="http://conversionxl.com/" class="liexternal">ConversionXL</a> blog. He recommends, “Building feedback loops to gather insights at every point in your customer lifecycle.”</p>
<p>Sounds simple in theory, but the<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2014/03/21/map-customer-journey-keep-customers-happy/" class="liinternal"> customer journey map</a> is dotted with potential touchpoints. Step into your customers’ shoes and walk through your businesses customer lifecycle to understand all the ways they may be interacting or looking for help from you:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27598 size-full" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CS-Customer-Journey.png" alt="CS-Customer Journey" width="497" height="477" /></p>
<p>Emailing feedback or <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/customer-satisfaction-surveys/" class="liinternal">customer satisfaction surveys</a> to your customers on regular intervals, or at important points in the customer lifecycle (like when they purchase, leave, or renew), is a simple way to get your feedback loop off the ground. Having a static “How are we doing?” link on your website is another way to make sure customers have a chance to tell you want they think.</p>
<p>But you also need to be on the lookout for feedback.</p>
<p>“Listen. Find as many ways to listen as possible,” Walker recommends. “Have phone conversations, do instant messages, use on-page surveys, do surveys every quarter, ask for net promoter scores. Make your job about listening and sorting the data, then create content.”</p>
<p>And don’t forget to keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/5-tips-managing-feedback-complaints-social-media" class="liinternal">complaints and feedback on social media</a>.</p>
<h4>Step 4: Look to the data</h4>
<p>Another key way to identify and anticipate customer service issues is by looking into your data for places where customers appear to be struggling. Depending on the type of issue, you can look for high exit rates, extremely long or short time on page, or decreased usage beyond a certain point in an app:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-27599 size-full" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CS-Data-to-identify-customer-issues.png" alt="CS-Data to identify customer issues" width="645" height="215" /></p>
<p>Maybe these kinds of issues are too small for customers to complain about. Or maybe customers can’t find a good way to get help. Matt Gratt, Sr. Marketing Manager at <a href="http://www.buzzstream.com/" class="liexternal">BuzzStream</a>, talked about how powerful this approach to developing content can be:</p>
<blockquote><p>We found that some of our new customers had trouble with a feature and abandoned their trial, so we created help materials around that feature. Not only did this increase trial activation and reduce churn, but non-customers found the best practices valuable enough to share.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Step 5: Connect with your customers</h4>
<p>When customers encounter a problem, it can be incredibly disruptive to their day. Getting them back on track certainly means getting them the right information. Your content also needs to speak to aggrieved customers the right way, according to Nathalie Nahai (also known as <a href="http://www.thewebpsychologist.com/" class="liexternal">The Web Psychologist</a>), the  best-selling author of <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Webs-Influence-Psychology-Online-Persuasion/dp/0273772953" class="liexternal">Webs Of Influence</a></em>:</p>
<blockquote><p>When someone comes to you in a heightened state emotionally—whether they’re upset or frustrated—they’re directing a lot of emotional tension toward you. One of the most crucial ways to offer support is to establish a sense of rapport. If you establish rapport, you’re much more likely to a) understand what they want, b) empathize with them, and c) get them to a resolution that will satisfy everyone.</p>
<p>If you have a number of customers with a similar issue and want to address it with content, use the language that other customers in their situation have fed back to you, make it clear you understand what they’ve gone through, and provide a solution.</p></blockquote>
<p>Nahai also notes that improving your customer service content can do a lot more than keep customers from leaving. “Research has found that when people are angry, they can often turn into the best advocates because they have so much energy,” she adds.</p>
<h4>Step 6: Keep help convenient and relevant</h4>
<p>When creating content for customer support, you also want to deliver it in the right place and the right time. If you&#8217;re not careful, that “Help” link can become a rabbit hole of inapplicable information.</p>
<p>Automated approaches can make things easy, says Laura Carper, Marketing &amp; Technology Coordinator at <a href="homesincolorado.com" class="liinternal">RE/MAX Alliance</a>, but providing awesome service takes more than setting up a help center. “It&#8217;s always important to try and target your audience,” she says. “So find a system that allows your consumer to choose what experiences they want to receive, rather than just sending everyone [to the same place].”</p>
<p>Make your help content discoverable. And when possible, link directly to the content that’s most likely to solve someone’s problems (rather than a top-level help or FAQ page). If all your customer service content is on one page, use anchor links, or create a clear system of organization to help customers find what they&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>These ideas are reinforced by the Genesys customer experience study. While interactions with a rep are often critical, convenient and personalized help are also important issues:</p>
<div id="attachment_27601" style="width: 590px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-27601" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/CS-customer-service-content.png" alt="From &quot;The Cost of Poor Customer Service&quot; by Genesys." width="580" height="512" /><p class="wp-caption-text">From &#8220;The Cost of Poor Customer Service&#8221; by Genesys.</p></div>
<h4>Step 7: Give visitors something actionable to do</h4>
<p>So you’ve anticipated your customers’ biggest issues. You&#8217;ve made it easy for them to find helpful content. Now what?</p>
<p>Your customer is likely to be asking the same question.</p>
<p>“For each content piece that we publish, we make sure to provide a call to action at the end so customers have a place to go or something to do after reading,” says Joseph Lei, Product Manager at online legal service <a href="https://www.rocketlawyer.com/" class="liinternal">RocketLawyer</a>. Giving a CTA (or some other kind of concrete next step) should make it easy for customers to get back into their groove.</p>
<p>You can also use this moment of resolution to get feedback—or give customers a chance to thank you publicly with social sharing buttons.</p>
<p>Even the best content may not resolve every problem, though. To make sure frustrated customers still have an avenue to get help, make sure you still give them a reasonable way to access to your customer support team.</p>

<img width="215" height="215" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/survey_priming.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="Survey Priming &amp; Timing: Small Changes Can Have a Big Impact on Bias" title="Survey Priming &amp; Timing: Small Changes Can Have a Big Impact on Bias" style="float:left;" /> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-27572" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/survey_priming.png" alt="survey_priming" width="250" height="250" />It’s possible you’ve heard this one before: Go hungry to a grocery store and you’re likely to come out with a shopping cart full of everything in the store except the refrigeration cases. Go on a full stomach, and you’re more apt to stick to your grocery list.</p>
<p>Why are we talking about shopping? Well, just as a person’s physical state can influence how they shop, a person’s mental state can influence the way they respond to your survey. <b>Their answers—and your results—might differ dramatically based on priming (psychological effects of question order) and timing (when you send your survey).</b></p>
<p>But with some planning, you can minimize the effects of priming and timing so you get results that accurately reflect your respondents’ attitudes and behaviors. Here’s how.</p>
<h4>When is the best time to send a survey?</h4>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-27560" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/timingsurveys.jpg" alt="timingsurveys" width="281" height="221" />If you’ve got a decision to make, you know that collecting accurate survey responses will help you make the most informed choice. And if you want to collect honest data, you need to really think about the effects of when you send your survey.</p>
<p>For example, say you work at an electronics manufacturer and your boss asks you to conduct a survey to measure your company’s <b> <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/net-promoter-score/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">Net Promoter® Score (NPS)</a></b>, a standard measurement that companies around the world use for <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/net-promoter-score-benchmarks-customer-loyalty/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">benchmarking customer satisfaction and loyalty</a></b>. The timing of when you send out your survey could yield different results for the question, &#8220;How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?&#8221;</p>
<p>If you send out the survey out to customers immediately after they purchase your product, your customer may not have had enough experience with the item to effectively answer whether they’d recommend your company to a friend or colleague. They also might still be in “shiny new toy” mode and give you a higher rating than they would if you sent out the survey a few weeks after their purchase. But, if you wait too long, they may have forgotten all about their experience with the product also making it hard for them to effectively answer that question.</p>
<h4>Keep your survey goals in mind</h4>
<p>So when should you send your survey? <b>The ideal time to send out your survey is determined by your <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/setting-survey-goal/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">survey’s goals</a>.</b> Want to assess how their experience was with the purchase process? Send it out immediately after they leave the store. Want to assess their satisfaction with the product? Send your survey a few weeks after their purchase so they’ve had some time to get their hands dirty with the product.</p>
<p>Another issue with timing is that often things happen that you couldn’t plan for in advance, which may impact your results. For example, if there is a recall for a product your company manufactures, the NPS of your company could change dramatically.</p>
<p>In this situation, you can take steps in the analysis process to still have meaningful data. Examine the responses before the recall announcement to get a sense of sentiment before the recall. Take a look at the responses after the recall announcement to determine if the recall had an impact on your customer loyalty. If it did have a negative impact, you still have your previous NPS <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2014/01/07/benchmark-surveys/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">benchmark</a></b> to now use as a goal for your company to aspire to.</p>
<h4>How to approach survey priming</h4>
<p>So that takes care of timing. But what is priming?</p>
<p><b><img class="alignleft wp-image-27566" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/survey_priming.jpg" alt="Good looking adult woman working at the office. Probably waiting for lunch..." width="300" height="200" />Priming definition:</b> In <b><a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/priming" class="liexternal">terms of psychology</a></b>, priming occurs when a person is exposed to a stimulus, and it influences how they respond to another stimulus. For example, if you were to see the word “yellow,” you’d be slightly faster than other people (who hadn’t seen that word) to recognize the word “banana.” That’s because people closely associate words like “yellow” and “banana” in their memory.</p>
<p>Let’s go back to the grocery store example—we mentioned that the state at which you enter into the store might have an effect on your purchases, but the layout of the grocery store may also influence what you buy. If the store displays fresh figs right in the entrance, you’ll be more likely to purchase figs on your trip than you would be if they were only in the produce section.</p>
<p>Similarly, you may be more likely to buy those chips that are right near you in the checkout line than if they were just in the aisle. Surveys are the same&#8211;depending on how you lay out your survey or order your questions, your results could differ.</p>
<p>If you specifically mention the device that the individual purchased in the email that invites them to the survey or in the survey introduction, they’ll be “primed” to be thinking about their experience with that specific item. With no mention of the item, they may be thinking about their experience with all the electronics they’ve purchased from your company, which may yield different results.</p>
<h4>Be smart about survey question order</h4>
<p>Think back to your survey goal. Are you trying to get a read on the overall sentiment about your company? Then don’t mention the item purchased. Trying to get a read on how the individual product impacted their feelings about your company? Go ahead and mention it!</p>
<p>We’ve already discussed <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/blog/2014/06/27/how-to-be-sure-images-in-your-survey-dont-skew-your-results/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">how images can influence the results</a></b>, but the order of the questions can also make a difference:</p>
<p>Ask the NPS question first and you get a top-of-the-mind reaction to your company. This helps you get a measure of what someone might say to a friend about you without carefully considering the many different factors that contribute to their overall feeling towards your company.</p>
<p>But what if you ask the NPS question after you’ve asked more specific questions about the service at the store, the check-out experience, the materials the product was made of, and how useful the product is? Well, that means that the respondent is primed to think about all of those factors when responding to the NPS question, giving a more holistic opinion of your company, which may be different from their top-of-the mind view.</p>
<p>Just like the timing issue, the right way to order your survey will depend on your goals and whether you want to get “snap judgments” about your company or whether you’d prefer to get an “informed review.” There’s a case for both.</p>

That&#8217;s not the sound of birds you&#8217;re hearing today but hundreds, thousands, millions of tweets heard &#8217;round the world. Twitter&#8212;the online social networking and microblogging service&#8212;<a href="http://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2014/07/29/tech-stocks-twitter/13309093/" target="_blank" class="liexternal">announces</a> their second quarter company earnings today. One of the interesting metrics that tech investors and users alike want to hear about have to do with how many active users Twitter has monthly.</p>
<p>Being naturally curious and into all things tech ourselves, we wanted to learn more about the popular social networking site&#8217;s users. Using <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/audience/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey Audience</a>&#8212;a powerful tool aimed at targeting specific demographics&#8212;we asked over 1,000 people how they use Twitter, how often and more. Our CEO, Dave Goldberg, sat down with Emily Chang of Bloomberg West to talk about what we found out.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s our breakdown of the survey results&#8212;and psst, don&#8217;t forget to tweet out the data to your followers (@SurveyMonkey)! Click <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/video/how-long-have-you-used-twitter-8rwpgJ01SgKfclXiEYTzRA.html" target="_blank" class="liexternal">here</a> for Dave&#8217;s full interview.</p>
<h4>Twitter awareness is high but not usage.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Most everyone has heard of Twitter. A whopping 98% of respondents have heard of the social networking giant.</li>
<li>While awareness is high, adoption is not. Over a third say they have accounts and for those aged 18-29, that number jumps to 45%.</li>
<li> 27% of people say they don&#8217;t find Twitter useful (ouch). And if they don&#8217;t currently have a Twitter account, they likely never will.</li>
</ul>
<h4> People follow friends and family the most.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Nearly 60% of Twitter users follow their friends and family over companies and brands.</li>
<li>News outlets are next at 42% and celebrity Twitter handles come in last. Sorry, Ashton Kutcher.</li>
<li>Even though most people say they don&#8217;t follow brands all that much, the majority still expect them to have some kind of a Twitter presence.</li>
</ul>
<h4> Ads on Twitter aren&#8217;t a big deal.</h4>
<ul>
<li>The little blue bird is either good at subtlety or its users are oblivious to their ads. 33% say they&#8217;ve never noticed ads or sponsored content by Twitter.</li>
<li>Nearly 40% notice paid ads and content &#8220;occasionally.&#8221;</li>
<li>Verdict is split on social ad &#8220;annoyance&#8221; with 31% reporting none at all and 35% saying they&#8217;re bothered only moderately.</li>
</ul>

<img width="215" height="215" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manual_data_entry.png" class="attachment-thumbnail wp-post-image" alt="How to Bring Your Offline Survey Data Online" title="How to Bring Your Offline Survey Data Online" style="float:left;" /> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-27575" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/manual_data_entry.png" alt="manual_data_entry" width="250" height="250" />As you may have noticed, we’re big lovers of online surveys. But we also know that some occasions may call for you to survey your respondents offline. Maybe your company took a nature retreat for its offsite, and there&#8217;s no wifi to be found! Of course, you want to get feedback before your attendees head back to civilization. So paper surveys it is.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you have a survey you’ve sent out by mail that allows respondents to either fill it out by paper or online. And after you&#8217;ve collected responses through those different survey modes, you want to be able to analyze your responses in aggregate, all in once place.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also possible you sent the same online survey twice—or collected data after your survey closed—and you just want to analyze one data set. Whatever the case, manually inputting those responses into your SurveyMonkey account will help you take advantage of our great <a href="http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-to-analyze-results" class="liexternal">analysis tools</a> and produce some superstar data!</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Step One: Create Your Survey</h4>
<p>To get this data input show on the road, first thing&#8217;s first: You need to have a survey in your SurveyMonkey account before you can enter in your data. Why? Well, for one, you can create your survey online, then <a href="http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Can-I-print-or-save-the-survey" class="liexternal">print it out</a> to distribute it to your respondents if need be. But also, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re going to be filling out your survey online for each person who takes it offline.</p>
<p>So if you&#8217;re strictly on paper, <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/sign-in/?ut_source=account_login" class="liinternal">log in</a></b> or <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/sign-up/?ut_source=account_login" class="liinternal">create a SurveyMonkey account</a></b>, then click <b>+Create Survey</b>. Head to <b>Design Survey</b> and use the <b>Builder</b> to recreate your survey online. It&#8217;s okay. We&#8217;ll wait&#8230;.</p>
<p>Ready? Let&#8217;s go!</p>
<h4>Step Two: Create Your Collector</h4>
<p>Now that you&#8217;ve got your survey in your account, it&#8217;s time to input that data. Head on over to the <b>Collect Responses</b> tab of your account, and choose the <b>Manual Data Entry Collector</b>.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27423" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SS11.png" alt="SS1[1]" width="1425" height="688" /></p>
<p>What if you already have a survey in your account with responses you collected online? If you collected those responses via our <b><a href="http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/Web-Link-Collector" class="liexternal">Web Link Collector</a></b>, just click on the <b>Collect Responses</b> tab, and then click the <b>Web Link Collector</b> in your list. Next click on the <b>+Manual Data Entry </b>in the upper right.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27425" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Screen-Shot-2014-07-22-at-4.43.04-PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-07-22 at 4.43.04 PM" width="1017" height="481" /></p>
<h4>Step Three: Input Survey Responses Manually</h4>
<p>Once your collector is created, you can start entering those responses! Click on the <b>+New Responses</b> button in the top right of the manual data entry field. This will take you directly to your survey so that you can enter the responses from your offline survey.</p>
<p>Make sure you answer your survey questions just as your respondent did. And you’ll want to click the <b>Done</b> button for each survey you fill out. This will ensure that your responses are recorded. You’ll be led back to the manual data entry form to go through the process for each of your respondents.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27427" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SS31.png" alt="SS3[1]" width="1022" height="394" /></p>
<p>If you distributed an <a href="http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-do-I-send-a-survey-through-SurveyMonkey-s-Email-Invitation-Collector" class="liexternal"><b>Email Invitation Collector</b></a> and would like to manually enter responses to that—no problem! Just click the email invitation collector from your collector list, and then click the grey <b>View Recipients</b> menu on the lefthand side of the page. If the respondent’s email is already part of your recipient list, go ahead and click their email address and then click <b>+Add Responses</b> to fill out the survey. If the respondent’s email isn’t part of the list yet, you can easily follow <b><a href="http://help.surveymonkey.com/articles/en_US/kb/How-do-I-add-an-email-address-to-an-existing-list" class="liexternal">these steps</a></b> to do so!</p>
<p>And just like that, you’ve reached your data entry destination. So head over to the <b>Analyze</b> tab to <b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/tour/crosstabfilter/" class="liinternal">slice and dice your data</a></b> and home in on data trends. We hope you now feel equipped with the tools to survey anywhere, anytime! Happy surveying trails to you, and we hope to see you again.</p>

<p>Getting the opportunity to showcase the diverse ways that our global customers are using <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey</a> is one of our favorite things to do here on the blog. Please join us in giving a warm monkey welcome to Marcelo Nobrega, Vice President of Human Resources at TAM Airlines&#8212;Brazil&#8217;s largest airline.</p>
<p><strong>Welcome, Marcelo!</strong></p>
<p>Every day at TAM Airlines, we ask ourselves: How can we keep our 28,000-strong workforce engaged and happy with their jobs? That’s a lot of people to stay in touch with&#8212;and it can take a lot of time to touch base with people in every department and region across Brazil. <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/pricing/enterprise/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey Enterprise</a> narrows the gap between my human resources team and our employees, making it easy for us to take the pulse of our workforce whenever we need to.</p>
<h4>Better than Paper</h4>
<p>Before <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey</a>, we sent out paper surveys to employees. There was usually a delay in getting the surveys back and compiling results, which meant we responded slowly to employee needs. We had staff who manually input survey results, but that process often created errors, so we couldn’t be sure that our survey results were accurate.</p>
<p>We regularly survey thousands of employees about our training classes in São Paulo, and we like to get their feedback so that we can continually improve training. Surveying class attendees seemed like a great place to get started with SurveyMonkey’s online surveys&#8212;and now, feedback from attendees is immediate.</p>
<h4>Shortening Training Classes</h4>
<p>SurveyMonkey helps us uncover ideas for improving training that we might not have figured out on our own. For instance, we found out that employees thought that some of the content in a three-day business strategy class was too basic. We decided to eliminate that content, which let us shorten the classes from three days to two days.</p>
<p>Similarly, we found out from surveys that employees attending our eight-hour training classes were typically working six-hour shifts, so we had to pay them for overtime – plus, people had to spend a very long day in the classroom. We decided the course material could just as easily be presented in six hours. Now we don’t have to pay overtime and employees are happier about the shorter sessions.</p>
<h4>Improving the HR Experience</h4>
<p>Once we realized how much fast and useful feedback we could obtain from SurveyMonkey, we decided to expand it to other HR programs. We’re surveying job candidates to learn how we can make the interview experience better, and we’re asking departing employees their opinions about the company so we can pinpoint problems earlier.</p>
<p>We’re even using surveys to find out what employees think of their office spaces&#8211;and we discovered they want some upgrades, so we’re dedicating budget to renovations. It’s just part of how SurveyMonkey helps us keep employees happy.</p>

But if you’re a young person fresh out of college, it usually means only one thing: Time to find a job. <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/survey-on-millennials-and-first-jobs-2014-6" target="_blank" class="liexternal">Business Insider</a> and <a href="http://www.newstoliveby.net/" target="_blank" class="liexternal">News to Live By</a> teamed up with <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/mp/audience/" target="_blank" class="liinternal">SurveyMonkey Audience</a> to learn about the challenges millennials face in finding their first full-time jobs. And we’ll be honest with you: It’s tough out there, especially as a millennial. While the national unemployment rate is currently 6.3%, 16% of millennials remain unemployed after six months in the job market. We say, chin up, enjoy your summer, and keep up the hard work—you’ll be working 9 to 5 in no time.</p>
<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>
<ul>
<li>72% of millennials have a degree but 44% say their first full-time job does not require one.</li>
<li>16% of millennials are not able to find work after six months in the job market.</li>
<li>24% of millennials apply to 11 or more full-time jobs before landing a position.</li>
<li>82% of millennials do not negotiate salary because they don’t feel comfortable or aren’t aware they can.</li>
<li>Of millennials who leave their first position, 26% say a higher salary would have kept them at the job.</li>
</ul>

We’ve made updates across SurveyMonkey to make it simple to measure your NPS. Now you can create your Net Promoter survey, calculate your score, and get context for your results—all in one place.</p>
<h4>Why Net Promoter Scores are important</h4>
<p>Net Promoter Scores are calculated by looking at your customers’ responses to a relatively simple survey question: “How likely is it that you would recommend this company to a friend or colleague?” If your customers give you high marks, research by Bain &amp; Company shows that you’re twice as likely to have long-term, profitable growth. Bottom line, you put yourself in good company when you calculate (and work to improve) your NPS score.</p>
<p>Here are all the improvements we’ve made to give you everything you need to make measuring your NPS a snap:</p>
<h4>New question type</h4>
<p>Net Promoter Score is now a question type that can be selected when you create your survey. When you’re in <strong>Design</strong>, just click to add it to your survey. You can use the question as is, or add your company or product name to make it more customized.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27233" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NPS-Create.png" alt="NPS Create" width="645" height="352" /></p>
<p>You can also create a Net Promoter survey by choosing the <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/net-promoter-score-survey-template/" class="liinternal">Net Promoter Score Template</a>.</p>
<p><b><a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/user/create-survey?template_id=257&amp;survey_title=Net%20Promoter%20Score" class="liinternal">To see how it works, click here</a> →</b></p>
<h4>Calculating NPS Scores</h4>
<p>Net promoter scores are calculated by counting up the number of Promoters (people who answered 9 or 10), subtracting the number of Detractors (people who answered 0 through 6), then dividing by the number of respondents.</p>
<p>Sound a little complex? Don’t worry—we’ll do the calculation for you.</p>
<p>When you get results from your Net Promoter survey, go to the <strong>Analyze</strong> section and you’ll see a gauge that shows your overall Net Promoter Score. You&#8217;ll also see a data table with the number (and percentage) of Detractors, Passives, and Promoters among your respondents, so you can see the detail surrounding how your NPS was calculated.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27238" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NPS-result.png" alt="NPS result" width="636" height="455" /></p>
<p>If you prefer, you can view a “distribution” chart of your results, showing your responses broken out by Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. All you have to do is follow a prompt to customize your chart, then choose a “Distribution Chart” to see this view:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27236" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NPS-bar-chart.png" alt="NPS bar chart" width="666" height="704" /></p>
<p>If you want to understand distribution with more granularity–for example, to see how low a rating your Detractors gave you—you can even set up a “Detailed Distribution” in the Depth menu.  The result is a bar chart that shows the number of responses for every answer option:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27234" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NPS-distribution-bar-chart.png" alt="NPS distribution bar chart" width="667" height="939" /></p>
<h4>Advanced Analysis with NPS data</h4>
<p>In addition, you can use all the other powerful analysis tools on SurveyMonkey to dive deeper into your NPS data.</p>
<p>See what makes your customers tick by looking at how responses to other questions in your survey affect your NPS results. For example, if you ask how long customers have used your product, you’ll be able to see the different NPS scores for each answer choice. Just create a <strong>COMPARE</strong> rule to see how longer-tenured customers feel about you:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27391" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NewCompareScreenshot1.png" alt="NewCompareScreenshot1" width="620" height="751" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similarly, you can use filters to look at how your Detractors or your Promoters answered your other questions. It’s easy to set up these filters in the <strong>FILTER BY Q&amp;A</strong> section next to your results.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-27235" src="https://www.surveymonkey.com/blog/en/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/NPS-filter-results.png" alt="NPS filter results" width="308" height="328" /></p>
<h4>See how your scores change</h4>
<p>A lot of companies run continuous NPS surveys that are always collecting data from their customers. Others calculate NPS scores monthly or quarterly.
