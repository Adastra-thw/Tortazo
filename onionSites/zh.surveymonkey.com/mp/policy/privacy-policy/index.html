We don't sell them to anyone and we don’t use the survey responses you collect for our own purposes, except in a limited set of circumstances (e.g. if we are compelled by a subpoena, or if you've made your survey responses public).</li>
    <li><strong>We safeguard respondents' email addresses.</strong> To make it easier for you to invite people to take your surveys via email, you may <a href="/help/tutorial/140/" target="_blank">upload lists of email addresses</a>, in which case SurveyMonkey acts as a mere custodian of that data. We don't sell these email addresses and we use them only as directed by you and in accordance with this policy. The same goes for any email addresses collected by your surveys.</li>
    <li><strong>We keep your data securely.</strong> Read our <a href="/mp/policy/security" target="_blank">Security Statement</a> for more information.</li>
    <li><strong>Survey data is stored on servers located in the United States.</strong> More information about this is available if you are located in <a href="/help/tutorial/5104/" target="_blank">Canada</a> or <a href="/help/tutorial/5103/" target="_blank">Europe</a>.

    <li><strong>Surveys are administered by survey creators.</strong> Survey creators conduct thousands of surveys each day using our services. We host the surveys on our websites and collect the responses that you submit to the survey creator. If you have any questions about a survey you are taking, please contact the survey creator directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that survey or your responses to it. The survey creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the survey and sometimes they have their own privacy policy.</li>
    <li><strong>Are your responses anonymous?</strong> This depends on how the survey creator has configured the survey. Contact them to find out, or click here to read more about <a href="/help/tutorial/3950" target="_blank">respondent anonymity</a>.</li>
    <li><strong>We don't sell your responses to third parties.</strong> SurveyMonkey doesn't sell or share your survey responses with third party advertisers or marketers (although the survey creator might, so check with them).  SurveyMonkey merely acts as a custodian on behalf of the survey creator who controls your data.</li>

<h2>Survey Creators & Survey Respondents</h2>
<p>SurveyMonkey is used by <strong>survey creators</strong> (people who create and conduct surveys online) and <strong>survey respondents</strong> (people who answer those surveys). The information we receive from survey creators and survey respondents and how we handle it differs, so we have split this privacy policy into two parts. Click on the one that applies to you:</p>

    <li class="item">What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
        <div>
            <p>When you use SurveyMonkey, we collect information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources. These are listed below. The sections afterward describe what we do with this information.</p>
            <p><strong>Information we collect directly from you</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Registration information.</strong> You need a SurveyMonkey account before you can create surveys on SurveyMonkey. When you register for an account, we collect your username, password and email address. If you choose to register by using a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), please see "Information from third parties" below.</li>
                <li><strong>Billing information.</strong> If you make a payment to SurveyMonkey, we require you to provide your billing details, such as a name, address, email address and financial information corresponding to your selected method of payment (e.g. a credit card number and expiration date or a bank account number). If you provide a billing address, we will regard that as the location of the account holder.</li>
                <li><strong>Account settings.</strong> You can set various preferences and personal details on pages like your <a href="/MyAccount.aspx" target="_blank">account settings page</a>. For example, your default language, timezone and communication preferences (e.g. opting in or out of receiving marketing emails from SurveyMonkey).</li>
                <li><strong>Address book information.</strong> We allow you to import email addresses into an <a href="/help/tutorial/150/" target="_blank">Address Book</a> and associate email addresses with <a href="/help/tutorial/140" target="_blank">email invitation collectors</a> so you can easily invite people to take your surveys via email. We don't use these email addresses for our own purposes or email them except at your direction.</li>
                <li><strong>Survey data.</strong> We store your survey data (questions and responses) for you.</li>
                <li><strong>Other data you intentionally share.</strong> We may collect your personal information or data if you submit it to us in other contexts. For example, if you provide us with a testimonial, or participate in a SurveyMonkey contest.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="d-box">
                <div class="con red-star">
                    <strong>We safeguard your respondents' email addresses.</strong> Rest assured, SurveyMonkey will not email your survey respondents or people in your Address Book except at your direction. We definitely don’t sell those email addresses to any third parties.
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Information we collect about you from other sources</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage data.</strong> We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, like most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Device data.</strong> We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address.</li>
                <li><strong>Referral data.</strong> If you arrive at a SurveyMonkey website from an external source (such as a link on another website or in an email), we record information about the source that referred you to us.</li>
                <li><strong>Information from third parties.</strong> We may collect your personal information or data from third parties if you give permission to those third parties to share your information with us. For example, you have the option of registering and signing into SurveyMonkey with your Facebook account details. If you do this, the authentication of your logon details is handled by Facebook and we only collect information about your Facebook account that you expressly agree to share with us at the time you give permission for your SurveyMonkey account to be linked to your Facebook account.</li>
                <li><strong>Information from page tags.</strong> We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug" target="_blank">web beacons</a>) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics.</li>

                        We know that, in many cases, you want to keep your survey questions and responses (which we collectively refer to as “survey data”) private. Unless you decide to <a href="/help/tutorial/263" target="_blank">share your survey</a> questions and/or responses with the public, we do not use your survey data for our own purposes, except in the limited circumstances described in this privacy policy or unless we have your express consent. We do not sell your survey data to third parties.

            <p>Generally, we use the information we collect from you in connection with providing our services to you and, on your behalf, to your survey respondents. For example, specific ways we use this information are listed below. (See the next section of this privacy policy to see who we share your information with.)</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>To provide you with our services.</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This includes providing you with customer support, which requires us to access your information to assist you (such as with survey design and creation or technical troubleshooting).</li>
                        <li class="red-star">Certain features of our services use the content of your survey questions and responses and your account information in additional ways. Feature descriptions will clearly identify where this is the case. You can avoid the use of your survey data in this way by simply choosing not to use such features. For example, by using our <a href="/help/tutorial/5166" target="_blank">Question Bank feature</a>,  to add questions to your surveys, you also permit us to aggregate the responses you receive to those questions with responses received by other Question Bank users who have used the same questions. We may then report statistics about the aggregated (and anonymized) data sent to you and other survey creators.</li>
                        <li>If you choose to link your SurveyMonkey account to a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we may use the information you allow us to collect from those third parties to provide you with additional features, services, and personalized content.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>To manage our services.</strong> We internally use your information, including certain survey data, for the following limited purposes:
                    <ul>
                        <li class="red-star"><strong>To monitor and improve our services and features.</strong> We internally perform statistical and other analysis on information we collect (including usage data, device data, referral data, and information from page tags) to analyze and measure user behavior and trends, to understand how people use our services, and to monitor, troubleshoot and improve our services. However, we do not use the non-public content of surveys (i.e. the content of questions and responses that you have not publicly shared) for these purposes.</li>
                        <li><strong>To assist the enforcement of our Terms of Use.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>To prevent potentially illegal activities.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>To screen for undesirable or abusive activity.</strong> For example, we have automated systems that screen content for phishing activities, spam, and fraud.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li class="red-star"><strong>To create new services, features or content (public data and metadata only).</strong> We may use public survey data and anonymized survey metadata (that is, data about the characteristics of a survey but not its non-public content), to create and provide new services, features or content. For example, we may look at statistics like response rates, question and answer word counts, and the average number of questions in a survey and publish interesting observations about these for informational or marketing purposes. When we do this, neither individual survey creators nor survey respondents will be identified or identifiable unless we have obtained their permission.</li>
                <li><strong>To facilitate account creation and the logon process.</strong> If you choose to link your SurveyMonkey account to a third party account (such as your Google or Facebook account), we use the information you allowed us to collect from those third parties to facilitate the account creation and login process. For more information, <a href="/help/tutorial/439/" target="_blank">click here</a>. </li>
                <li><strong>To contact you about your service or account.</strong> We occasionally send you communications of a transactional nature (e.g. service-related announcements, billing-related matters, changes to our services or policies, a welcome email when you first register). You can't opt out of these communications since they are required to provide our services to you.</li>
                <li><strong>To contact you for marketing purposes (if you opt in).</strong> We will only do this if you have given us your express permission to contact you for this purpose. For example, during the account registration process we will ask for your permission to use your information to contact you for promotional purposes. You may opt out of these communications at any time by clicking on the "unsubscribe" link in them, or changing the relevant setting on your <a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/MyAccount.aspx" target="_blank">My Account</a> page.</li>
                <li><strong>To respond to legal requests and prevent harm.</strong> If we receive a subpoena or other legal request, we may need to inspect the data we hold to determine how to respond.</li>

                        <strong>When might we disclose your survey data to third parties? </strong> Only for a limited number of reasons. Mostly commonly, we share your information with our service providers who help us to provide our services to you. We contractually bind these service providers to keep your information confidential and to use it only for the purpose of providing their services to us. For example, we use payment processors who help us to process credit card transactions.  By using our services, you authorize SurveyMonkey to sub-contract in this manner on your behalf.  
                        <p>Rarer circumstances include when we need to share information if required by law, or in a corporate restructuring or acquisition context (see below for more details).</p>

            <p>We recognize that you have entrusted us with safeguarding the privacy of your information. Because that trust is very important to us, the only time we will disclose or share your personal information or survey data with a third party is when we have done one of three things, in accordance with applicable law: (a) given you notice, such as in this privacy policy; (b) obtained your express consent, such as through an opt-in checkbox; or (c) anonymized the information so that individuals cannot be identified by it.  Where required by law, we will obtain your express consent prior to disclosing or sharing any personal information.</p>
            <p>We may disclose:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Your information to our service providers.</strong> We use service providers who help us to provide you with our services. We give relevant persons working for some of these providers access to your information, but only to the extent necessary for them to perform their services for us. We also implement reasonable contractual and technical protections to ensure the confidentiality of your personal information and data is maintained, used only for the provision of their services to us, and handled in accordance with this privacy policy. Examples of service providers include payment processors, email service providers, and web traffic analytics tools.</li>
                <li><strong>Your account details to your billing contact.</strong> If your details (as the account holder) are different to the billing contact listed for your account, we may disclose your identity and account details to the billing contact upon their request (we also will usually attempt to notify you of such requests).  By using our services and agreeing to this privacy policy, you consent to this disclosure.</li>
                <li><strong>Aggregated information to third parties to improve or promote our services.</strong> No individuals can be identified or linked to any part of the information we share with third parties to improve or promote our services.</li>
                <li><strong>The presence of a cookie to advertise our services.</strong> We may ask advertisers to display ads promoting our services on other websites. We may ask them to deliver those ads based on the presence of a cookie but in doing so will not share any other information with the advertiser.</li>
                <li><strong>Your information if required or permitted by law.</strong> We may disclose your information as required or permitted by law, or when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, and/or to comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, subpoena, or other legal process served on us.</li>
                <li><strong>Your information if there's a change in business ownership or structure.</strong> If ownership of all or substantially all of our business changes, or we undertake a corporate reorganization (including a merger or consolidation) or any other action or transfer between SurveyMonkey entities, you expressly consent to SurveyMonkey transferring your information to the new owner or successor entity so that we can continue providing our services. If required, SurveyMonkey will notify the applicable data protection agency in each jurisdiction of such a transfer in accordance with the notification procedures under applicable data protection laws.</li>
                <li><strong>Information you expressly consent to be shared.</strong> For example, we may expressly request your permission to provide your contact details to third parties for various purposes, including to allow those third parties to contact you for marketing purposes. (You may later revoke your permission, but if you wish to stop receiving communications from a third party to which we provided your information with your permission, you will need to contact that third party directly.)</li>

                <li><strong>Download/backup your survey data.</strong> We provide you with the ability to export, share and publish your survey data in a variety of formats.

                <li><strong>Delete your survey data.</strong> Deleting survey data in the ways described on <a href="/help/tutorial/67" target="_blank">this page</a> will not permanently delete survey data immediately.

                <li><strong>Cancel your account.</strong> To cancel and delete your account, please contact <a href="mailto:mailto:support@surveymonkey.com">customer support</a>.

We will respond to any such request, and any appropriate request to access, correct, update or delete your personal information within the time period specified by law (if applicable) or without excessive delay. We will promptly fulfill requests to delete personal data unless the request is not technically feasible or such data is required to be retained by law (in which case we will block access to such data, if required by law).</li>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>"Personal data".</strong> For users located in the EU, references to "personal information" in this policy are equivalent to what is commonly referred to as "personal data" in the EU.</li>
                <li><strong>About IP addresses.</strong> Our servers record the incoming IP addresses of visitors to our websites (whether or not the visitor has a SurveyMonkey account) and store the IP addresses in log files. We use these log files for purposes such as system administration  and maintenance, record keeping, tracking referring web sites, inferring your location, and security purposes (e.g. controlling abuse, spam and DDOS attacks). We also store IP addresses along with certain actions you take on our system. IP addresses are only linked to survey responses if a survey creator has configured a survey to collect IP addresses. By agreeing to this privacy policy, you expressly consent to SurveyMonkey using your IP address for the foregoing purposes. If you wish to opt out from the foregoing consent to use your IP address, you must cancel your account (if you have one) or not respond to a survey if requested to do so.</li>
                <li><strong>Data controller.</strong> SurveyMonkey Europe Sarl, whose contact information is listed above, is the data controller for registration, billing and other account information that we collect from users in the EU. However, the data controller for survey data is the survey creator. The survey creator determines how their survey questions and responses are used and disclosed. SurveyMonkey only processes such survey data in accordance with the instructions and permissions (including those given under this privacy policy) selected by the survey creator when they create and administer their survey.</li>
                <li><strong>Accessing and correcting your personal data.</strong> You have the right to access and correct the personal information that SurveyMonkey holds about you. This right may be exercised through by visiting your account's <a href="/MyAccount.aspx" target="_blank">My Account</a> page or by emailing <a href="mailto:support@surveymonkey.com">support@surveymonkey.com</a>.</li>
                <li><strong>Your responsibilities.</strong> By using our services, you agree to comply with applicable data protection requirements when collecting and using your survey data, such as requirements to inform respondents about the specific uses and disclosures of their data.</li>

<ol>
    <li class="item">What information does SurveyMonkey collect?
        <div>
            <p>When you respond to surveys hosted by SurveyMonkey, we collect, on behalf and upon instructions (including the ones provided in this privacy policy) of survey creators, information relating to you and your use of our services from a variety of sources. These are listed below. The sections afterward describe what we do with this information.</p>
            <p><strong>Information we collect directly from you</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Survey responses.</strong> We collect and store the survey responses that you submit. The survey creator is responsible for this data and manages it. A survey may ask you to provide personal information or data. If you have any questions about a survey you are taking, please contact the survey creator directly as SurveyMonkey is not responsible for the content of that survey. The survey creator is usually the same person that invited you to take the survey and sometimes they have their own privacy policy.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="d-box">
                <div class="con red-star">
                    <strong>Are your survey responses anonymous?</strong> You will need to ask the survey creator this as it depends on how they have chosen to configure their survey. We provide instructions on how a survey creator can ensure they <a href="/help/tutorial/335" target="_bank">collect responses anonymously</a>. However, even if a survey creator has followed those steps, specific questions in the survey may still ask you for your personal information or data that could be used to identify you.
                </div>
            </div>
            <p><strong>Information we collect about you from other sources</strong> </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Usage data.</strong> We collect usage data about you whenever you interact with our services. This may include which webpages you visit, what you click on, when you performed those actions, and so on. Additionally, as with most websites today, our web servers keep log files that record data each time a device accesses those servers. The log files contain data about the nature of each access, including originating IP addresses. Note that we do not link this usage data to your survey responses.</li>
                <li><strong>Device data.</strong> We collect data from the device and application you use to access our services, such as your IP address and browser type. We may also infer your geographic location based on your IP address. Your IP address will be linked to your survey responses unless a survey creator has <a href="/help/tutorial/188" target="_blank">disabled IP address collection</a> for the survey you respond to.</li>
                <li><strong>Referral data.</strong> We record information about the source that referred you to a survey (e.g. a link on a website or in an email).</li>
                <li><strong>Information from page tags.</strong> We use third party tracking services that employ cookies and page tags (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_bug" target="_blank">web beacons</a>) to collect aggregated and anonymized data about visitors to our websites. This data includes usage and user statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>Your email address.</strong> If a survey creator uses an <a href="/help/tutorial/140" target="_blank">email invitation collector</a> to send you a survey invitation email, we collect your email address when the survey creator provides it to us. We don’t use this to send you email except at the direction of a survey creator. The emails we send on behalf of a survey creator appear to come from that survey creator's email address.</li>

                <div class="con red-star">
                    <strong>Providing survey responses is voluntary.</strong> Remember, you can always choose not to provide an answer to any given survey question (especially those requesting your personal information or data). However, sometimes this will prevent you from completing a survey if the survey creator has marked that question as requiring an answer.
