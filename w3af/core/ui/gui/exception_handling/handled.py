    In w3af's new exception handling method, some exceptions raising from
    plugins are "allowed" and the scan is NOT stopped because of them.

    At the same time, developers still want users to report their bugs.

    Because of that, we need to have a handler that at the end of the scan
    will allow the user to report the exceptions that were found during the
    scan.

    The main class in this game is core.controllers.core_helpers.exception_handler
    and you should read it before this one.
