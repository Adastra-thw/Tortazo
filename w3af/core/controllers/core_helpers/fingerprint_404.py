        All of my previous versions of is_404 were very complex and tried to
        struggle with all possible cases. The truth is that in most "strange"
        cases I was failing miserably, so now I changed my 404 detection once
        again, but keeping it as simple as possible.

        Also, and because I was trying to cover ALL CASES, I was performing a
        lot of requests in order to cover them, which in most situations was
        unnecesary.

            1- Cover the simplest case of all using only 1 HTTP request
            2- Give the users the power to configure the 404 detection by
               setting a string that identifies the 404 response (in case we
               are missing it for some reason in case #1)
