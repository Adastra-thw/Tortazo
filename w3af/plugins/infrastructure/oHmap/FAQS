   ======================================================================

   Q: What's the use of fingerprinting a web server? Even if a hacker
      couldn't precisely identify a server certainly he could just run his
      full gamut of attacks?

   A: Of course, but it's usually in a hackers interest to gather
      information before an attack.  My guess would be that the more
      sophiticated hackers will do sophisticated information gathering as a
      prelude to an attack.

   Q: How can I make my web server so that it can't be fingerprinted?

   A: Do you really need to?
      - if you are up to date on your patches and have locked it down 
         as much as possible there may be better ways to spend
         your time.

      - If you are really gungho, I'm collecting server hiding techniques
        in the HIDING_GUIDE document.

   Q: I found a test you don't have.
 
   A: Cool. I'd be surprised if I had found every possible test.  Before
       you send it too me:
        - Check my list (KNOWN_TESTS) of already identified tests to make
          sure it's really new.
        - If you are up to it, add it into the tool and make sure it works
          the way you think it should.
        - Show me which servers it discriminates.  Even if it doesn't
          discriminate anything new, it still might be interesting for
          other reasons (stealth, new direction to look for tests, etc.)
        - Cool, lets add it to my battery of tests and now you are famous
          (well at least i'll give you acknowledgements for it...)

   Q: Why did you use python? Real hackers use perl.

   A: If you say so.  Here's one hacker that thinks python is pretty cool
      (http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882).  I originally
      wrote it all in perl then grew dissatisfied with the code.  I've been
      much more productive with it in it's new form.

   Q: Breaking into web servers and defacing them is no big deal why worry?
      
   A: Two reasons. 

      (1) Go to securityfocus.com and look at some of the security issues
          that web servers are open to.  Many of them are Denial of Service
          (DoS) or running arbitrary code.  Those are prety serious issues.

      (2) People are running alot more web (HTTP) servers than they might
          know:
          - printer configuration interfaces 
          - help manuals
          - WebDAV 
	  - etc.

   Q: Isn't hiding the identity of your server just security thru
      obscurity?

   A: Obscurity is only frowned upon when its the mechanism of the security
      that is hidden.  For instance the lock on a door requires obscurity -
      a key whose exact shape is known only to the key holder.  How locks
      work is not hidden but the "secret" that opens a specific door is
      kept obscure.  In otherwords if you see obscurity in a security
      scenario it's not automatically bad.  Furthermore, why not use every
      thing you have in your arsenal to defend your site?

   Q: Wouldn't it be cool if, after determining the exact webserver, it then
      gave list of vulnerablities for that server and scanned for them?

   A: Lots of good scanners already exist that could be modified to work
      that way (e.g. whisker).  Lots of smart people are already working 
      on that.  I think this tool complements that work though.

   Q: I have a server that's not on your list.

   A: I'm looking for access to webservers with different vendor/version/OS
      combos.  If you have a combination that I don't have already I'd be
      interested in using it to create a profile and to test/verify
      against.  I'll gladly add you to my acknowledgements list.
