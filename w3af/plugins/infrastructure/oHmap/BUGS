======================================================================

- if the default page (e.g. index.html) is missing profiles tend to be
  way off

- some requests return NO_RESPONSE message intermittently
   - makes long error range type tests somewhat unreliable for some servers
   - don't know if this is a problem with my code or the server or
     with the connection
