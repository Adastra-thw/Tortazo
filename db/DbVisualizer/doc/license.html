</p>

<h2>2. Ownership</h2>
<p>

   licensed, not sold. Title and copyrights to the Software, in whole and in
   part and all copies thereof, and all modifications, enhancements, derivatives
   and other alterations of the Software regardless of who made any

</p>

<h2>3. Grant of License</h2>
<b>For DbVisualizer Pro:</b>

   in this EULA:
</p>

<ul>
   <li>

      requires an additional License Key.
   </li>

      make copies of the Software and the License Key as reasonably necessary
      for the use authorized by this EULA, including as needed for backup and/or
      archival purposes. No other copies may be made. Each copy must reproduce

      Product.
   </li>
   <li>
      The non-transferability notwithstanding, users may transfer a license to another user in
      the same organization, when, and only when, the designated licensee (user) moves to
      non-database tasks or leaves the organization.
   </li>
</ul>

<b>For DbVisualizer Free:</b>

<p>
   Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the

      notices on or in the Software Product.
   </li>
</ul>

<h2>4. Evaluation License</h2>
<p>
   A time limited version of the
   DbVisualizer Pro edition of the Software,

   period of twenty one (21) days ("Evaluation Period") from the date of issuing
   a temporary evaluation License Key. The time limited version is subject to
   all terms set forth in this EULA with the exception that the Evaluation
   License is not for general commercial use.
</p>

<p>
   The Software contains a feature that will automatically disable the
   DbVisualizer Pro edition of the Software
   after the Evaluation Period has expired. Licensee may not disable, destroy,
   or remove this feature of the Software, and any attempt to do so will be in
   violation of this EULA and immediately terminate this agreement.
</p>

<h2>5. License Restrictions</h2>
<b>Licensee may not:</b>

   disclaimed, except to the extent that these disclaimers are held to be
   legally invalid.
</p>

<h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>
   To the extent not prohibited by law, in no event will Licensor (or any

   the use of or inability to use Software, even if Licensor has been advised of
   the possibility of such damages.
</p>

<p>
   In no event will Licensor's liability to Licensee, whether in contract, tort
   (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by Licensee for
   Software under this EULA. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the
   above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not

   terms above may not be applicable to Licensee.

   any time by destroying all copies of Software.

   or control of Licensee must be destroyed and written confirmation of such
   destruction provided to Licensor.

   may take actions so that Software no longer operates.

   this EULA may only be brought in, and shall be subject to the jurisdiction
   of, any court of Sweden.
</p>

   the intent of the parties, in which case this EULA will immediately
   terminate.
</p>

<p>
   This EULA, including License Certificate, is the entire agreement between
   Licensee and Licensor relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior
   or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations
   and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any
