    <dd>A Ruby is part of an annotation pair - a piece of text ("Ruby Text") that is 
        associated with another piece of text known as a "Ruby Base". A common 
        need for such a structure arises in some asian writing systems where a ruby 
        association is used to present helper readings for uncommonly used writing 
        characters. 
        <br><br>

        With a character set as complex as Chinese or Japanese, some characters are used
        rarely and are thus not as easily recognizable by younger children or possibly
        many adults. In Japanese writing, for example, the phonetic Hiragana alphabet 
        is used to pair phonetic 'helper' readings (called Furigana or Yomigana in 
        Japanese) with the Chinese character counterpart.
        <br><br>

        A Ruby text will usually be rendered next to the Base text such that the 
        association between each Base text and Ruby text is clear (often directly 
        above the Base text.) Ruby text is usually also rendered in a smaller font 
        than the Base text to help visually clarify which part is which in the 
        association relationship.
        <br><br>
        
        Ruby markup has two main usage modes in XHTML - Simple Rubies, where 
        a single annotation or helper text is associated with a single piece of 
        Base text, and Complex Rubies, where as many as two Ruby text annotations 
        can be bound to a single piece of Base text. Complex Rubies also allow 
        Base text and Ruby text to be broken down further, so that even more 
        detailed associations can be made between them.
        <br><br>
        
<dt><big><b class="mainheading">Simple Rubies</b></big>
    <dd>Simple Rubies will often be the only type of annotation mechanism that most 
        authors need. In this type of ruby markup, two main elements exist nested 
        in the RUBY element - the Base text (the <a href="r/rb.htm">RB</a> element), 
        followed by the Ruby text (the <a href="r/rt.htm">RT</a> element.) 
        <br><br>
        
        For browsers that do not understand the RUBY markup, they will display the 
        content of the RT element directly following the contents of the RB content. 
        Since this sort of fallback may not be enough to distinguish the association 
        relationship between the two content pieces, one final, optional fallback 
        element is provided to make the association clear in non-supporting browser 
        scenarios: the <a href="r/rp.htm">RP</a> element. An RP element containing 
        a single character (usually an open or close parenthesis, depending on 
        the context - RP <em>DOES</em> stand for Ruby <em>Parenthesis</em>...) should 
        be put on either side of the RT element. Ruby-supporting browsers should 
        ignore the RP element completely and not render it in any way; in 
        non-supporting browsers however, the contents of the RP element will surround 
        the RT content to tie the content with the previous RB content.
        <br><br>

<dt><big><b class="mainheading">Complex Rubies</b></big>
    <dd>Complex rubies can have multiple Base elements, and multiple Ruby Text 
        components. In a Complex Ruby, all of the Base elements (<a href="r/rb.htm">RB</a>) 
        are enclosed in an <a href="r/rbc.htm">RBC</a> element (RBC: Ruby Base 
        Container.) For the Ruby Text elements (<a href="r/rt.htm">RT</a>), these 
        are enclosed in an <a href="r/rtc.htm">RTC</a> element (RTC: Ruby Text 
        Container.) A Complex Ruby can have one or two RTC elements which allows 
        for two text associations to be given for any given Base text. Default 
        rendering might render the first RTC group <em>ABOVE</em> the Base text, 
        with the second RTC group possibly rendered <em>BELOW</em> the Base text... 
        but, this rendering is definitely not guaranteed - allowances for alternate 
        writing directions (eg: vertical rather than horizontal) and other criteria 
        can complicate rendering, and CSS properties have already been proposed 
        specifically for Ruby markup in future CSS versions to control these details.
        <br><br>

        The content of the Ruby Base Container (RBC) is, of course, RB elements. 
        Similarly, the content of any Ruby Text Containers (RTC) are RT elements. 
        With Complex Rubies, RT elements have an additional attribute RBSPAN which 
        acts like COLSPAN does for TD and TH elements in tables - it allows a 
        piece of Ruby Text content to be associated with multiple RB base elements.
