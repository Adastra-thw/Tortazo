     <ul>
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Site Design Conversion to CSS1</b></big><br>
         The entire site uses CSS1. What this means is that all non-CSS browsers 
         will see rather boring looking pages, but the information and structure 
         will all be intact. For CSS enabled browsers, the old color scheme is 
         still in place for now, and can be easily changed for your own use if 
         you decide to download it.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Common Attributes</b></big><br>
         There are now many attributes that are applicable to many different elements.
         I have relied on existing official documentation to fill in a few gaps 
         where I could not directly or easily test the features. The official 
         documentation sometimes contradicts itself, so be warned that there CAN
         be some errors here.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Script</b></big><br>
         The portion of the site that covers scripting does not go deeply into scripting.
         Discussion of scripting quickly gets out of the realm and scope of HTML.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Miscellaneous Elements and Attributes</b></big><br>
         I have tried to document as many known elements and attributes as possible,
         gathered from official and semi-official resources. I also occasionally find
         or am alerted to unadvertised features. I do the best that I can to keep
         on top of this, but occasional errors occur. Also keep in mind that I have
         made guesses and extrapolated support information in a few cases due to
         missing information and lack of browser availability on different platforms.
         I try to stress this fact where it occurs.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Platform Information</b></big><br>
         The information for this site concentrates predominantly on browsers
         made for the Windows platform (win32 mostly, win16 for some of the early
         history.) There are often significant differences in support between
         the various platforms, so the support and version information here will not
         always be valid for the respective browser version on a different platform.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Tag Models (Parent/Content relationships,
         etc.)</b></big><br>
         The element relationship and definition models are mostly based off of the
         HTML 4.0 Recommendation &quot;Loose&quot; DTD. HTML 4.0 is the
         most cohesive model available to authors as of the time of writing. There
         are occasionally a few points of departure that I make to the HTML 4.0
         model and I have tried to point out exactly <em>WHY</em> I chose a different
         interpretation when this occurs.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Page Validation</b></big><br>
         As of November 1997, I have spell-checked the entire site and validated
         all of these pages against the HTML 4.0 &quot;loose&quot; DTD with the
         <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validation Service</a>. I
         don't do this often (I only did this once previously against HTML 3.2),
         so as I add or update content along the way and massage some
         of these pages it is possible that this may fall out of date.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Slight Regression in HTML/CSS Support
         Between previous browser versions and betas</b></big><br>
         Most browsers have historically only added support and functionality as time
         progresses. But a special case occurred with Microsoft Internet Explorer.
         The rendering and parsing engine for IE4 was re-built from scratch. This has led
         to a few idiosyncrasies between the betas of IE4 and the IE3 releases.
         These have basically cleared up by the final release, but I try to document
         these discrepancies where known. (Note: The same situation also occurred 
         with the early releases of Mozilla/Netscape 6, which also used a brand 
         new rendering engine.)
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Significant divergences in HTML Support
         Between Mosaic 3 Betas and Mosaic 3 Final</b></big><br>
         The early Mac Mosaic 3.0 Betas had significantly different support than what
         is found in the final releases (eg: frames capability.) I have tried
         to keep this clear by noting which elements/attributes were supported in
         <em>BOTH</em> M3 Betas and final by listing support as 'M3.0' and features
         supported in only the betas by listing support as 'M3.0Bx.' Hopefully
         this is not <em>too</em> confusing.
