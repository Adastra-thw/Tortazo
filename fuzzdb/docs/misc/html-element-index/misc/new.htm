<dl>
<dt><big><b class="mainheading">Welcome!</b></big>
    <dd>Welcome to Index DOT Html and Index DOT Css - technical references about
        the HTML and CSS languages.
</dl>

<big><b class="mainheading">What's new in this version</b></big>
<ul>
    <li>Updated the general attribute section of the site
    <li>Updated the browser histories to reflect the recent upheaval
</ul>

<big><b class="mainheading">Other recent changes</b></big>
<ul>
    <li>The HTML half of the site has been updated for XHTML 1 and 1.1, as well as 
        the newest browsers
    <li>The CSS half of the site has been updated for the newest browsers. (I 
        contemplated adding CSS 2.1 to the support information, but it is not 
        mature enough yet.)
    <li>All browser histories have been updated, including a new skeleton history
        for Mac IE (I need to do a lot of research here to fill in this history
        page so that will have to wait.)
    <li>All HTML/CSS specification history pages have been updated
    <li>The main indexes have received a significant facelift: 
        added a site search capability via Google's sitesearch; 
        The new toolbar at the top makes some of the functions much more prominent;
        Sidebar on the right side has been created to allow me to communicate 
        "breaking news" more easily.        
    <li>Style sheet changing mechanism should be less visually annoying to most 
        users when it applies its effects, and now works in Mozilla too.
    <li>Added a bunch of resources to the "Chat" button, including many helpful
        external discussion sites, newsgroups and mailing lists.
    <li>Cleared some of my huge email backlog of things to add to the site. I 
        still have a long way to go on this.
</ul>


<dl>
<dt><big><b class="mainheading">Future plans for the site</b></big><br>
    Here is my current to-do list: 
    <ul type=disc>
        <li>Support for Bidi has been added in Opera - I need to change the support charts to reflect 
            this.
        <li>Bring more contributing authors into the mix so that this site does
            not consume so much of my life. 8-}
        <li>Create test files for every browser "peculiarity" assertion I list, 
            so that I can check them more easily with each new browser version.
            [The <a href="../testing/htmltester.htm">HTML code creator</a> javascript 
            page has been useful in my global testing, but I need to document the 
            browser errata in a much more formal way that can be documented.
        <li>Wrap up all the email issues regarding information to add to the 
            site that I have still pending.
        <li>Write a few CSS articles on topics I have wanted to cover for a very long time.
    </ul>
