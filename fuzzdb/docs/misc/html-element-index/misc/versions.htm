     I have tried to keep this list as up to date as possible, but errors can
     always occur. Companies release software VERY quickly and sometimes with
     little fanfare (and other times with an alarming amount of it. =) I used to 
     keep up to date with the latest browser news using a site called BrowserWatch, 
     but that site seems to have died like so many other DotCom casualties. So now, 
     I have a much harder time keeping up on some of the browser's releases 
     (but not all...I'm currently working on Opera, so - I think I have that 
     covered. ;) If I have missed any releases, please <a href="email.htm">alert 
     me</a> to them if you see them before I do, or if you hear of new features 
     being added to the mentioned browsers that have not been included in this site yet...
     <br><br>

     Heck, for that matter, if you can think of good reasons to survey other
     browsers, or can provide help in testing the browsers for their capabilities,
     I would welcome it! It seems that the only way to find out about some of
     these elements/attributes/properties/etc. is to see for yourself if they 
     work. =)

<big><b class="mainheading">How do I test HTML and CSS?</b></big>
<hr align="left" width="40%">
     This is a new little topic I thought I would write off the top of my head...
     In the past I tested HTML and CSS behavior in a very ad-hoc manner. While
     I was good at that, some browsers (namely IE) did not play nice together
     with other versions of itself, so I could only test one or two of those
     browsers at a time. Meanwhile, I had been collecting browser binaries for
     years so that I could test them when I needed (I now have 3 CDs full of
     browser binaries if you are in such a need, let me know...another great
     source for that sort of thing is <a href="http://browsers.evolt.org/">Evolt</a>.)
     <br><br>

     Last year, I built a new machine with the intention of using a system I
     had tried at work called <a href="http://www.vmware.com/">VMWare</a> -
     it allows you to run multiple operating systems at once on a single
     machine (its biggest drawback is that it can consume huuuuge amounts of
     RAM if you let it, but RAM prices are not that bad these days, so my
     machine is happy even with 4-5 Virtual machines running at once.) I can
     now test on a single machine as many browsers as I like side-by-side. Finally,
     I can do comparison testing on any browser version on any Microsoft or
     Linux OS at the same time.
     <br><br>

     That's just geek-sexy if you ask me. =)
     <br><br>

     Often times, I am still ad-hoc testing browser behaviors, but the process
     is becoming faster and more streamlined. Geez...the things I do to bring
     you more accurate information! ;)
