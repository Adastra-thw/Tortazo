     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Site Reflects CSS2 Views</b></big><br>
         The site reflects the point of view of the CSS2 Recommendation. Differences
         between CSS1 and CSS2 are noted where they are known.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Site Design Using CSS1</b></big><br>
         The site currently uses CSS for the majority of its rendering effects.
         What this means is that all non-CSS browsers will see rather boring looking
         pages, but the information and structure will all be intact. For CSS enabled
         browsers, you can use the default stylesheet or choose another to use as the 
         default.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Platform Information</b></big><br>
         The information for this site concentrates predominantly on browsers
         made for the Windows platform (win32 mostly.) There are often significant
         differences in support between the various platforms, so the support and
         version information here will not always be valid for respective
         browser versions on different platforms.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Page Validation</b></big><br>
         As of August 1999, I have spell-checked the entire site and validated
         all of these pages against the HTML 4.0 &quot;loose&quot; DTD with the
         <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validation Service</a>. I
         will not do this very often, so as I add or update content along the
         way and massage some of these pages it is possible that this may fall
         out of date.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Slight Regression in HTML/CSS Support
         in some browser betas</b></big><br>
         Most browsers have historically only added support and functionality as time
         progresses. But special cases <em>have</em> occurred.  In the case of Microsoft
         Internet Explorer 4.0, the rendering and parsing engine was re-built from scratch.
         This led to a few idiosyncrasies between the betas of IE4 and the IE3 releases.
         These cleared up by the final release, but I try to document these discrepancies
         where known. Early versions of Netscape 6 also used a brand new rendering
         engine, and support discrepancies also occured in this process too.
     <li><big><b class="mainheading">Inspiration/Source for Many Documented CSS
         Bugs</b></big><br>
         There are many resources on the Internet that also document CSS bugs in the
         various browsers. In researching browser bugs, I consulted many of these
         resources as well as creating my own test files. Here is a listing of
         resources consulted, along with a heartfelt thanks to the authors for their
         existence - browser makers seldom go out of their way to make bugs in
         their products public.<br>
