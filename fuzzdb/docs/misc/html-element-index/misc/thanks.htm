There are many who have helped me create these documents,
in the form of advice or suggestions as well as sanity checking and
proof-reading. In no particular order...

<ul>
<li><b class="subheading">Tapio Markula</b><br>
    I've been corresponding with Tapio for some time about CSS matters, and
    the bugs/browser behaviors we both try to document. His own
    <a href="http://gamma.nic.fi/~tapio1/Teaching/index2.php3">site on CSS</a>
    in Finnish/English is a similar resource to my own in that we both are
    trying to get to the bottom of just WHAT the browsers do and don't support
    from the standards.
<li><b class="subheading">Ronald and &quot;Engineer
    Dave&quot;</b><br>
    In the early days of the site for providing tons of ideas,
    encouragement and content as well as feedback as to whether the pages
    were readable to the common man.
<li><b class="subheading">Stephen LeHunte</b><br>
    Who created the HTML Reference Library (a wonderful resource, but it is sadly 
    no longer being updated.) Through many emails on the latest goings-on in HTML 
    and CSS he was one of the few not to have that glazed over, bored, 
    &quot;uh-huh&quot; response to conversations about this subject. =)
    He also was kind enough to let me borrow heavily from his site license
    concept and wording (thankyouthankyou.)
<li><b class="subheading">CSS Browser Bug Site creators</b><br>
    There are many resources on the Internet that also document CSS bugs in the
    various browsers. In researching browser bugs to document on this site,
    I consulted many of these resources as well as creating my own test files.
    Here is a listing of resources consulted, along with a heartfelt thanks to
    the authors for their existence - browser makers seldom go out of their way
    to make bugs in their products public.<br>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>CSS Pointers Group's <a href="http://www.css.nu/pointers/">CSS Bugs and Workarounds</a>
        <li>Eric Meyer's <a href="http://www.webreview.com/style/css1/charts/mastergrid.shtml">CSS
            Master Compatibility Chart</a> at Webreview.com
        <li>Style Master's <a href="http://www.westciv.com/style_master/academy/browser_support/index.html">House
            of Style</a> resource
        <li>David Baron's <a href="http://dbaron.org/css/test/">CSS tests</a>
        <li>Stephan Nedregaard's <em>CSS support in popular browsers</em> (site now gone)
        <li>Braden McDaniel's <a href="http://www.endoframe.com/css/ie3.html">Support for
            CSS1 in MSIE 3.0, Win32</a>
        <li>Ian Graham's <a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/ian/style/cssbugs/toc.html">CSS
            Bugs and Implementation Problems, with Workarounds</a>
     </ul>
<li><b class="subheading">The HTML Writer's Guild and
    Comp.infosystems.www.authoring.*</b>
    <br>Great minds and even better feedback in these forums for authors.
<li><b class="subheading">Tim Berners-Lee</b><br>For sending a response regarding
    the early days of HTML when I ran into a bunch of dead links on the
    subject on the web. Oh, and of course he also created the WWW and HTML -
    For that we should all be grateful! =)
<li><b class="subheading">The Mirror Site Maintainers</b><br>For the space
    and their time - all donated. The web isn't <em>totally</em>
    commercialized yet.
<li>There were <b class="subheading">many others</b> that kept me pointed
    in the right direction, gave feedback and alerted me to undocumented
    browser behaviors. If I tried to list them all, I would inevitably forget
    someone. For all of you, this is a general, genuine THANKS!! =)
