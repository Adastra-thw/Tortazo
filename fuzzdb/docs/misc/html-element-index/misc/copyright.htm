I claim copyright where possible over the many portions of the two sites which
are original work (such as many parts of the Cascading Style Sheet site) and
over the both sites as a singular, evolving work, along with the general HTML
formatting scheme (look and feel.) All images are copyright 1996-2005
Brian Wilson.
<br><br>
Information about version history of tag and property support in the mentioned 
browsers and other data was gathered though a series of sometimes painstaking 
manual verifications. The information is as accurate as I could determine given 
my resources and appears to be the most complete resource to date (that I can
find at least) on this topic. While neither I nor anyone else can claim direct
copyright over the content of the tag history pages (anyone who has the ability
and or patience could duplicate this work), it is unlikely that many will try
to duplicate this silly feat. =) Please at least cite me as the source if you
reference the information that I have gathered here for another purpose.
<br><br>
Aside from that, if you can help add to this resource, please let me know so
that it can be updated. These sites are meant to create a single, cohesive
resource on the HTML language, CSS and the popular browsers that support them;
it would be a waste of efforts (I think) if this did not succeed.
