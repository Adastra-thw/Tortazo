 <td valign=top align=right><a name="ascii"><b class="subheading">ASCII</b></a></td>
 <td valign=top align=left>Acronym for 'American Standard Code for Information
     Interchange.' ASCII is the dominant character set encoding used by present-day
     computers (this may slowly change.) Current ASCII uses 7 bits of data for each
     character, allowing for 128 distinct character code points.</td>

 <td valign=top align=left>Acronym for Backus-Naur Form. This was originally a 
     syntax used to define the ALGOL programming language in the late 1950s/early 
     60s. First created by John Backus and refined a year later by Peter Naur. It 
     soon became the de-facto presentation method of conveying the formal syntax 
     of a programming language, and many programmatic syntax analysis tools (such 
     as LEX and YACC) also use variations of this syntax.</td>

     CALS is a Department of Defense (DoD) strategy for achieving effective

     equipment. Parts of the HTML table model were modeled after the CALS table
     implementation. More information can be found from the US Navy CALS home

 <td valign=top align=right><a name="cdata"><b class="subheading">CDATA</b></a></td>
 <td valign=top align=left>Abbreviation for Character Data. CDATA is a data type model 
     used in SGML and XML with DTDs. According to HTML 4.0,
     <blockquote class="quotation">"CDATA is a <em><b>sequence of characters from the 
     document character set</b></em> and may include character entities. User agents should 
     interpret attribute values as follows:
     <ul>
         <li>Replace character entities with characters
         <li>Ignore line feeds
         <li>Replace each carriage return or tab with a single space.
         <li>User agents may ignore leading and trailing white space in CDATA 
             attribute values"
     </ul>
     </blockquote>
     The documentation for HTML 4 also places many additional constraints on 
     various attribute's values which are often not expressable using DTD syntax 
     or data types. On this site, the constrained set of values are described.<br><br>

     <b class="alert2">Note:</b> In HTML 4+ and XHTML, the "document character set"
     is Unicode. In HTML 2.0, 3.0 and 3.2, it is ISO-8859-1.</td>

 <td valign=top align=right><a name="dither"><b class="subheading">Dither</b></a></td>
 <td valign=top align=left>Color dithering simulates a color value that can't
     be displayed using a mixture of displayable colors, eg: gray can be
     created by mixing black and white values. This allows non-displayable
     colors to be implied to the eye - it is tricked into blending the
     color mixture into the intended color. The ratios and pattern of the
     color mix, along with the resolution of the display device are factors
     determining the quality of the dithering effect. </td>
