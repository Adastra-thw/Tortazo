...that is the message you will most often see leading off my response
to e-mails that people send me about the site.
<br><br>

I create and maintain this site alone in my <em>SPARE TIME</em>. It
sometimes requires a <em>LOT</em> of effort to do the research and
editing needed with only one person, so my e-mail often suffers and
the backlog just grows and grows.
<br><br>

I have finally decided that I can not take the time to respond to
<em>EVERY</em> e-mail that I receive <em>AND</em> make headway on
maintaining the site. So, something has to suffer - I just can't
respond to mails requesting help or easy solutions to problems
all the time like I used to try to do. The main source of knowledge
that I have to give anyway <em>IS</em> the information on the site,
so it can't hurt to look for the answer there. I <em>AM</em>
certainly open to requests for addressing new things on the site that
aren't there now or are currently unclear.
<br><br>

So... don't let the previous bit daunt you too much - if you want
to send me e-mail, I can be reached at
<img src="../../pics/addy.gif"> [yes, it's an image to lower the amount of spam I get.] It just
may take me a <em>LONG</em> time to respond. =)
