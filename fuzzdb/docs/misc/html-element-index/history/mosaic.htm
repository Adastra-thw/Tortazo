     <td valign=top align=left colspan=2>Mosaic is the oldest of the three
         reviewed browsers. It is <u>THE</u> popular pioneer in the GUI browser
         market and one of the main ingredients in the initial overwhelming
         success of the World Wide Web. It is also the basis for many other
         popular browsers. It is produced by the National Center for Supercomputing
         Applications (NCSA), which licenses its code under the name of Spyglass.
         The releases of Mosaic have been characterized by multiple pre-releases
         over extended periods of time. The 2.0 version time span occurred over
         almost 2 years; a time span which saw the greatest changes in the
         browser market thus far.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top><big><b class="mainheading">Version<br>Discrepancies</b></big></td>
         <td valign=top align=left colspan=2> There are occasional extreme differences
         in both timeline and HTML capability between platforms for identical
         Mosaic release versions. The early Unix versions of Mosaic, for example,
         were developed well before most of the other platforms, and Unix/VMS
         version numbers have differed significantly from other platform counterparts.
         Early work on Mosaic 3.0 was completed only on the Macintosh platform,
         which added features such as frames. Many of these features did not make
         it into the later final release of the 3.0 version.</td>

     <td valign=top><big><b class="mainheading">No More<br>Mosaic</b></big></td>
     <td valign=top align=left colspan=2>NCSA announced in January, 1997 that it
         was halting development of the Mosaic browser in order to concentrate on
         other activities. Coverage of what the historical Mosaic versions supported
         will remain on these pages, as it provides an important benchmark against
         which other browsers developed. The final Mosaic release is 3.0</td>

         backs away from the features found in the earlier Macintosh 3.0 betas. The
         previous rudimentary frames capability and other improvements are lost
         in this, the <b class="magicword"><em>FINAL</em></b> release of Mosaic from
         NCSA. The only significant HTML change in this release over 2.0 versions is
         improvement of table functionality (finally allowing for nested tables.)</td>
