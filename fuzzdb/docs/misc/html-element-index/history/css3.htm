<hr width="80%" align=left>
Currently no browser supports CSS1 entirely, although many are pretty close now.
The additions and changes in CSS2 went untouched for a <em>LONG</em> time by the
browser-makers, but the market is <em>FINALLY</em> seeing wide-scale adoption of
that standard. Of course, while browser-makers were taking their time in
producing real implementations of CSS2, the folks at the W3C and its mailing
lists were thinking about the future.
<br><br>

In December 1998 a W3C note was published (see above) containing a large
laundry-list of items that have been suggested for inclusion in CSS3. It
is likely that many of these features will be cut (in fact, the Note
included a "voting" utility to help build feedback on public wishes
for these features.)
<br><br>

Since this original "Note" was published, CSS has been broken down into
sub-modules. Work on these documents, which integrate all of the CSS1 and CSS2
work, as well as enhancements above and beyond them is under way. The W3C has
posted a planned timeline for the work on these CSS3 modules. When we might see
wide-scale compliance of CSS3 in browsers? Well, that's another matter. (Frankly, 
the number of proposed new CSS properties in the various modules is nothing 
short of frightening - both for the page author and the simple human that 
creates this particular site. )
