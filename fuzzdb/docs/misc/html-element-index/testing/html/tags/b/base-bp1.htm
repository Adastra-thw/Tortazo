<big><b><u>Assertion:</u></b></big>
<div class="assert">Netscape and Opera both ignore improperly terminated URLs used 
as the BASE HREF value. eg: relative URLs in a document that used "http://www.blooberry.com" 
as the HREF would resolve to "http://[relative URL]", and "http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot" 
would resolve to "http://www.blooberry.com/[relative URL]". To prevent this problem, use 
a trailing "/" character to properly terminate the URL. Internet Explorer, by the way, accepts both URL forms.</div>
<br>

<b>BASE element refers to "http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/", hyperlink refers to "index.html" <br>
(Should successfully link to the Indexdot main page):</b>
