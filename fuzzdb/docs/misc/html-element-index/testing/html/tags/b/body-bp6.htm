<big><b><u>Assertion:</u></b></big>
<div class="assert">Until each of their 4.0 Beta 2 versions, both Netscape and 
Internet Explorer have not allowed an animated Gif to be used as a background image. 
Sometimes only the first frame of the animation would be shown - otherwise no image at all. 
Warning: even though background animations are now possible, PLEASE exercise caution 
in their use! This behavior could be many more times as annoying (and headache causing =)) 
to readers than special effects such as BLINK or MARQUEE ever have been.</div>
