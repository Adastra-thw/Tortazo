<big><b><u>Assertion:</u></b></big>
<div class="assert">Netscape 4.x can not correctly hyperlink to a bookmark (A NAME) 
that is nested inside a LAYER element from another document. It succeeds in jumping 
to the document, and it does attempt to jump within the document, but I didn't see 
a particular pattern to where it was jumping to...but it isn't the correct location. 
Hyperlinking to a bookmark nested in a LAYER from within the same document appears to work correctly.</div>

<b>Simple link to another document with bookmark (A NAME). Document should scroll 
so that the bookmark with the blue background is in view.</b>
<hr>
<a href="layeraname1.htm#bookmark1">Click on the link to see the described behavior</a>

<b>Link to another document with bookmark (A NAME) nested in a layer at the bottom 
of the page. Document should scroll so that the bookmark with the green background is in view.:</b>

<a href="layeraname1.htm#layer1">Click on the link to see the described behavior</a>

<b>Link to another document. At the top are links to bookmarks/anchors WITHIN the document.
Anchors in LAYERs work within the document context but not externally:</b>
