# About doc/tools
#

These tools require docutils available from http://docutils.sourceforge.net

These file are available from docutils respository but since they are not
installed by default as on "Sep  8 2005" we are including them here as
reference. If any of them has been modified it is specified in the file header.

We use these and other tools from docutils to generate the documentation on
different formats
