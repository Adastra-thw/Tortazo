The default file was taken from the fuzzdb project http://code.google.com/p/fuzzdb/
(errors.txt in folder regex) and w3af's error_pages plugin. It is able to
find more generic strings which leads to more false positives but simplifies
the process of finding customized error messages.

The fuzzdb file was extended with more strings.
