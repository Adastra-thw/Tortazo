Bug reporting
=============

The framework is under continuous development and we might introduce bugs and regressions while trying to implement new features. We use continuous integration and heavy unit and integration testing to avoid most of these but some simply reach to our users (doh!)

Good bug reporting practices
----------------------------

If you're using **the latest version of the framework** and find a bug, please `report it <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/issues/new>`_ including the following information:

 * Detailed steps to reproduce it
 * Expected and obtained output
 * Python traceback (if exists)
 * Output of the ``./w3af_console --version`` command
 * Log file with verbose set to ``True`` (see below)

When reporting installation bugs and issues that might relate to your environment, it is a good idea to include `detailed system information <https://gist.githubusercontent.com/andresriancho/9873639/raw/adaff04e2ffe95dfd0b0069a294297107249f7b3/collect-sysinfo.py>`_.

.. code-block:: none

	user@box:~/w3af$ wget http://goo.gl/eXpPDl
	user@box:~/w3af$ chmod +x collect-sysinfo.py
	user@box:~/w3af$ ./collect-sysinfo.py

This will generate a file called ``/tmp/w3af-sysinfo.txt`` which you may include in your bug report.

Making sure you're on the latest version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``w3af`` is usually installed in two different ways by our users:

 * ``apt-get install w3af`` (or similar)
 * ``git clone git@github.com:andresriancho/w3af.git``

Installing using the Operating System package manager is the easiest way, but will usually install an old version of the software that won't be able to :doc:`update.rst`. For reporting bugs we recommend you install the latest ``w3af`` from our repository.

Cloning from the git repository into a directory in your home is the recommended way and will allow auto-updates which guarantee you're always using the latest and greatest.

Getting the specific ``w3af`` version is easy using the ``--version`` command line argument:

.. code-block:: none

	user@box:~/w3af$ ./w3af_console --version
	w3af - Web Application Attack and Audit Framework
	Version: 1.5
	Revision: 4d66c2040d - 17 Mar 2014 21:17
	Branch: master
	Local changes: Yes
	Author: Andres Riancho and the w3af team.
	user@box:~/w3af$ 

The output of the command is simple to understand, but lets go through it just in case:

 * ``Version: 1.5``: The w3af version number
 * ``Revision: 4d66c2040d - 17 Mar 2014 21:17``: If this line is present you've installed ``w3af`` by cloning from our repository. ``4d66c2040d`` is the SHA1 ID of the latest ``git`` commit your system knows about.
 * ``Branch: master``: The ``git`` branch your installation is running from. In most cases this should be one of ``master`` or ``develop``.
 * ``Local changes: Yes``: Indicates if you've manually modified ``w3af``'s source code

Just to make sure you're on the latest version run ``git pull`` inside the ``w3af`` directory making sure that ``Already up-to-date.`` appears:

.. code-block:: none

	user@box:~/w3af$ git pull
	Already up-to-date.

Now you're ready to report a bug!

Basic debugging
---------------

When you want to know what the framework is doing the best way is to enable the ``text_file`` output plugin, making sure that the ``verbose`` configuration setting set to ``true``. This will generate a very detailed output file which can be used to gain an insight on ``w3af``'s internals.

.. code-block:: none

    plugins
    output text_file
    output config text_file
    set verbose True
    back

False negatives
---------------

If ``w3af`` is failing to identify a vulnerability which you manually verified please make sure that:

 * The ``audit`` plugin that identifies that vulnerability is enabled
 * Using basic debugging, make sure that ``w3af`` finds the URL and parameter associated with the vulnerability. If you don't see that in the log, make sure the ``crawl.web_spider`` plugin is enabled.

False negatives should be `reported just like bugs <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/issues/new>`_ , including all the same information.

False positives
---------------

Nobody likes false positives, you go from the adrenaline of "The site is vulnerable to SQL injection!" to "Nope, false positive" in less than a minute. Not good for your heart.

Please report the false positives `like bugs <https://github.com/andresriancho/w3af/issues/new>`_ , in our repository. Include as much information as possible, remember that we'll have to verify the false positive, write a unittest and then fix it.
