# Tortazo

Stem is a powerful libreary written in Python to perform various operations against TOR Clients and Directory Authorities. The information retreived using Stem could be very useful to an attacker to get information about the relays available in the TOR network

Tortazo is an open source Python Script to gather information about ExitNodes in the TOR Network and create a Botnet with compromised ExitNodes over SSH.

* **Use Shodan** - Using a valid Shodan Key, you can gather information about an ExitNode.
* **Use Nmap** - Using python-nmap, Tortazo is able to perform NMap scans against a list of ExitNodes
* **track** - upload a track to the Echo Nest and receive summary information about the track including key, duration, mode, tempo, time signature along with detailed track info including timbre, pitch, rhythm and loudness information.
